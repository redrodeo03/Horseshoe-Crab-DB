Currently, there is a lack of research on the toxicological effects of combined exposure to horseshoe crabs. In this study, we investigated the effects of NPs and copper on the expression of molt-related genes and gut microbiome in juvenile tri-spine horseshoe crabs Tachypleus tridentatus by exposing them to NPs (100 nm, 104 particles L-1) and/or Cu2+ (10 μgL-1) in seawater for 21 days. Compared with the control group, the relative mRNA expression of ecdysone receptor (EcR), retinoid x receptor (RXR), calmodulin-A-like isoform X1 (CaM X1), and heat shock 70 kDa protein (Hsp70) were significantly increased under the combined stress of NPs and Cu2+. There were no significant differences in the diversity and abundance indices of the gut microbial population of horseshoe crabs between the NPs and/or Cu2+ groups and the control group. According to linear discriminant analysis, Oleobacillus was the most abundant microorganism in the NPs and Cu2+ stress groups. These results indicate that exposure to either NPs stress alone or combined NPs and Cu2+ stress can promote the expression levels of juvenile molting genes. NPs exposure has a greater impact on the gut microbial community structure of juvenile horseshoe crabs compared to Cu2+ exposure. This study is helpful for predicting the growth and development of horseshoe crabs under complex environmental pollution.",10.1016/j.marenvres.2023.106128,
200,Metal Levels in Delaware Bay Horseshoe Crab Eggs from the Surface Reflect Metals in Egg Clutches Laid beneath the Sand.,Joanna Burger,2023,"Understanding variations in metal levels in biota geographically and under different environmental conditions is essential to determining risk to organisms themselves and to their predators. It is often difficult to determine food chain relationships because predators may eat several different prey types. Horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) eggs form the basis for a complex food web in Delaware Bay, New Jersey, USA. Female horseshoe crabs lay thumb-sized clutches of eggs, several cm below the surface, and often dislodge previously laid eggs that are brought to the surface by wave action, where they are accessible and critical food for migrant shorebirds. This paper compares metal and metalloid (chromium [Cr], cadmium [Cd], lead [Pb], mercury [Hg], arsenic [As] and selenium [Se]) concentrations in horseshoe crab eggs collected on the surface with concentrations in eggs from clutches excavated from below the sand surface, as well as examining metals in eggs from different parts of the Bay. The eggs were all collected in May 2019, corresponding to the presence of the four main species of shorebirds migrating through Delaware Bay. These migrating birds eat almost entirely horseshoe crab eggs during their stopover in Delaware Bay, and there are differences in the levels of metals in blood of different shorebirds. These differences could be due to whether they have access to egg clutches below sand (ruddy turnstones, Arenaria interpres) or only to eggs on the surface (the threatened red knot [Calidris canutus rufa] and other species of shorebirds). Correlations between metals in clutches were also examined. Except for As and Cd, there were no significant differences between the metals in crab egg clutches and eggs on the surface that shorebirds, gulls, and other predators eat. There were significant locational differences in metal levels in horseshoe crab eggs (except for Pb), with most metals being highest in the sites on the lower portion of Delaware Bay. Most metals in crab eggs have declined since studies were conducted in the mid-1990s but were similar to levels in horseshoe crab eggs in 2012. The data continue to provide important monitoring and assessment information for a keystone species in an ecosystem that supports many species, including threatened and declining shorebird species during spring migration.",10.3390/toxics11070614,
201,Comparative physicochemical analysis of chitin quality of the two tagmata in the exoskeleton of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus.,"Juan José Sandoval-Gío, José Manuel Cervantes-Uc, Gerardo Rivera-Muñoz, Carlos Juan Alvarado-López",2023,"Recently, chitin biopolymer has received much attention as a wide variety of biomedical application for this and its derivatives have been reported, in fact, the study of non-conventional species as alternative sources of them compounds has taken particular interest. Here, we present a comparative physicochemical survey of the two tagmata in the exoskeleton of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus: the prosoma and the opisthosoma, collected in Yucatán, Mexico. The characterization included CHNSO analysis, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, and SEM. The CHNSO analysis revealed that C is present in the highest proportion (∼45 %) and that chemical composition did not show significant differences (P < 0.05) between the two tagmata. FTIR spectra of two tagmata presented a wide characteristic band of the chitin between 3600 and 3000 cm-1, confirming the presence of this biopolymer in the exoskeleton studied. TGA and DTGA profiles resulted very similar for both tagmata being the residual mass at 650 °C of around 30 % for both samples; these values were associated to the presence of minerals. SEM micrographs showed a porous matrix with infinite large number of irregularly shaped particles. Results show that both tagmata are made up of chitin, and they seem to have a high mineral content.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.125563,

Factor C synthesis via genetic engineering offers a solution to replace natural horseshoe crab's factor C and prevent its excessive harvest from nature. In response to these concerns, this study aimed to characterize the amebocyte lysates and factor C protein modeling of T. gigas originated from Banyuasin South Sumatra Estuary. Sampling of T. gigas was carried out in Banyuasin South Sumatra Estuary, Indonesia. The endotoxin test or TAL (Tachypleus amebocyte lysates) assay was performed using gel coagulation method. Protein characterization of protease enzyme was conducted by protease activity, SDS-PAGE, and zymogram analysis. The cDNA of mitochondrial COI gene was amplified for molecular identification followed by cDNA cloning of factor C. Protein modeling was investigated by molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. Endotoxin test results showed that TAL-35 had endotoxin sensitivity in a range of 0.0156-1 EU/ml, while TAL 36 had a sensitivity between 00,625 and 1 EU/ml. T. gigas amebocytes have protease activity in molecular mass sizes less than 60 kDa, with 367 U/ml for TAL 35 and 430 U/ml for TAL 36. The molecular identification revealed 98.68% identity similarity to T. gigas. The docking results suggested three ligands; i.e., diphosphoryl lipid A, core lipid A, and Kdo2 lipid A can be activators of the factor C protein by binding to the region of the receptor to form a ligand-receptor complex. Endotoxins can be detected using horseshoe crab amebocytes. The presence of proteases is considered responsible for this ability, as evidenced by casein zymogram results. According to docking and MD analysis, we found that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) participate to the binding site of factor C.",10.1186/s43141-023-00496-8,
203,Effects of Ca2+ ions on the horseshoe crab coagulation cascade triggered by lipopolysaccharide.,"Keisuke Yamashita, Daisuke Takahashi, Yuki Yamamoto, Shingo Kiyomoto, Toshio Shibata, Shun-Ichiro Kawabata",2023,"The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered horseshoe crab coagulation cascade is composed of three protease zymogens, prochelicerase C (proC), prochelicerase B (proB) and the proclotting enzyme (proCE). In this study, we found that Ca 2+ ions increase the production of the clotting enzyme as a result of a cascade reaction reconstituted by recombinant proteins of wild-type (WT) proC, WT proB and WT proCE. We divided the cascade into three stages: autocatalytic activation of WT proC on the surface of LPS into WT α-chelicerase C (Stage 1); activation of WT proB on the surface of LPS into WT chelicerase B by WT α-chelicerase C (Stage 2) and activation of WT proce into WT CE by chelicerase B (Stage 3). Ca2+ ions enhanced the proteolytic activation in Stage 2, but not those in Stages 1 and 3. Moreover, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry to clarify the interaction of LPS or the recombinant zymogens with Ca2+ ions. LPS interacted with Ca2+ ions at an association constant of Ka = 4.7 × 104 M-1, but not with any of the recombinant zymogens. We concluded that LPS bound with Ca2+ ions facilitates the chain reaction of the cascade as a more efficient scaffold than LPS itself.",10.1093/jb/mvad018,

Tachypleus tridentatus has existed on earth for more than 430 million years. It has suffered a sharp decline in population numbers caused by environmental pollution and anthropogenic disturbance for almost 40 years. However, the effects of heavy metal pollution on juvenile T. tridentatus have not been reported. Here we show the mechanism of cadmium (Cd) detoxification in juvenile T. tridentatus using integrated antioxidant indexes and transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis. High Cd2+ concentration caused oxidative stress in juvenile T. tridentatus. The hazards increase with increasing Cd2+ concentration in juvenile T. tridentatus. Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses concluded that high Cd2+ concentration resulted in the imbalance of glycerophospholipid metabolism in juvenile T. tridentatus to detoxify Cd. Our results offer a rationale for protective measures and further studies of heavy metal stress in T. tridentatus.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114585,

Negative changes in wet weight and prosomal width of the juveniles were observed in all treatments of microplastics, but significant difference was only detected in prosomal width between control and PMMA. T. tridentatus became significantly less active upon exposure to nylon and PET. The extent of burrowing by T. tridentatus did not significantly differ among the treatments but was overall significantly reduced towards day 100. T. tridentatus exposed to PET significantly showed the lowest survival probability (30 %), compared to the other treatments (70-90 %). In conclusion, high-density microplastics compromised growth and behaviour of juvenile horseshoe crabs. Among the polymers that were tested, PET was considered more harmful and associated with higher mortality.",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114535,
206,"Characterization of two novel ammonia transporters, HIAT1α and HIAT1β, in the American Horseshoe Crab, Limulus polyphemus.","Maria Sachs, Alex R Quijada-Rodriguez, Stephanie Hans, Dirk Weihrauch",2023,"The American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, excretes nitrogenous waste in the form of toxic ammonia across their book gills. The mechanism of this branchial excretion is yet unknown. In the current study, two isoforms of a novel ammonia transporter, LpHIAT1α and LpHIAT1β, have been identified in L. polyphemus. Both isoforms have 12 predicted transmembrane regions and share 82.7% of amino acid identity to each other, and 77-86% amino acid homology to HIAT1 found in fish and crustaceans. In L. polyphemus, both isoforms were expressed in the gills, coxal glands, and brain. Slightly higher mRNA expression levels of LpHIAT1α were observed in the peripheral mitochondria-poor region of the gill (PMPA), central mitochondria-rich region of the gill (CMRA), and brain compared to the LpHIAT1β isoform. A functional expression analysis of LpHIAT1α and LpHIAT1β in Xenopus laevis oocytes resulted in a significantly lower uptake of the radiolabeled ammonia analogue 3H-methylamine when compared to controls, indicating an ammonia excretory function of the proteins. Exposure to elevated environmental ammonia (HEA, 1 mmol l-1 NH4Cl) caused an increase in mRNA expression of LpHIAT1β in the ion-conductive ventral gill half. High mRNA expression of both isoforms in the brain, and the observation that LpHIAT1α and LpHIAT1β likely mediate cellular ammonia excretion, suggests that these highly conserved ammonia transporters have an important housekeeping function in cellular ammonia elimination.",10.1016/j.cbpa.2022.111365,

The HSC hemocytes store defense molecules that are released upon encountering invading pathogens. The HSCs rely on this innate immunity to continue its existence as a living fossil for more than 480 million years. To gain insight into the innate mechanisms involved, transcriptomic analysis was performed on isolated C. rotundicauda hemocytes challenged with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the main components of the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria. RNA-sequencing with Illumina HiSeq platform resulted in 232,628,086 and 245,448,176 raw reads corresponding to 190,326,253 and 201,180,020 high-quality mappable reads from control and LPS-stimulated hemocytes, respectively. Following LPS-stimulation, 79 genes were significantly upregulated and 265 genes were downregulated. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were related to multiple immune functional categories and pathways such as those of the cytoskeleton, Toll and Imd, apoptosis, MAP kinase (MAPK), inositol phosphate metabolism, phagosome, leucocyte endothelial migration, and gram-negative bacterial infection, among others. This study provides important information about the mechanisms of response to LPS, which is relevant for the understanding the HSCs' immune response.",10.3390/cimb44120399,

Recent studies in the northern Beibu Gulf, China demonstrated that nesting sites of Asian horseshoe crabs are typically close to their nursery beaches with high-density juveniles distributed around mangrove, seagrass and other structured habitats. A laboratory Y-maze chamber was used to test whether the dispersal of early-stage juvenile tri-spine horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus is facilitated by chemical cues to approach suitable nursery habitats. The juvenile orientation to either side of the chamber containing controlled seawater or another with various vegetation cues, as well as their movement time, the largest distance and displacement were recorded. The juveniles preferred to orient toward seagrass Halophila beccarii cues when the concentration reached 0.5 g l-1, but ceased at 2 g l-1. The results can be interpreted as a shelter-seeking process to get closer to the preferred settlement habitats. However, the juveniles exhibited avoidance behaviors in the presence of mangrove Avicennia marina and invasive saltmarsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora at 2 g l-1. The juveniles also spent less time moving in the presence of the A. marina cue, as well as reduced displacement in water containing the S. alterniflora cue at 1 and 2 g l-1. These results may explain the absence of juvenile T. tridentatus within densely vegetated areas, which have generally higher organic matter and hydrogen sulfide. Early-stage juvenile T. tridentatus are capable of detecting and responding to habitat chemical cues, which can help guide them to high-quality settlement habitats. Preserving and restoring seagrass beds in the intertidal areas should be prioritized when formulating habitat conservation and management initiatives for the declining horseshoe crab populations.",10.7717/peerj.14465,

The cornea of these eyes contains hundreds of inward projecting elongated cuticular cones and concentrate light onto proximal photoreceptor cells. Although this visual system has been extensively studied before, the precise mechanism allowing vision has remained controversial. Correlating high-resolution quantitative refractive index (RI) mapping and structural analysis, it is demonstrated how gradients of RI in the cornea stem from structural and compositional gradients in the cornea. In particular, these RI variations result from the chitin-protein fibers architecture, heterogeneity in protein composition, and bromine doping, as well as spatial variation in water content resulting from matrix cross-linking on the one hand and cuticle porosity on the other hand. Combining the realistic cornea structure and measured RI gradients with full-wave optical modeling and ray tracing, it is revealed that the light collection mechanism switches from refraction-based graded index (GRIN) optics at normal light incidence to combined GRIN and total internal reflection mechanism at high incident angles. The optical properties of the cornea are governed by different mechanisms at different hierarchical levels, demonstrating the remarkable versatility of arthropod cuticle.",10.1002/advs.202203371,

211,"Microplastic transfer from the American horseshoe crab to shorebirds through consumption of horseshoe crab eggs in Jamaica Bay, NY.","Royall McMahon Ward, Emily M Casper, J Alan Clark, Mark L Botton",2022,"Microplastic transfer between horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus) and migratory shorebirds through consumption of crab eggs was examined in Jamaica Bay, New York. Fertilized and unfertilized crab eggs, shorebird fecal pellets, beach sand, and bay water were processed with a hydrogen peroxide solution to remove organic material, then stained with a Nile Red to identify microplastics using fluorescence microscopy. Microplastics were present in all samples and ranged from approximately26-1300 μm. Unfertilized and fertilized eggs contained significantly higher numbers of microplastic particles per gram than shorebird fecal pellets, beach sand, and bay water. The presence of microplastics in unfertilized egg samples indicates that microplastics undergo maternal transfer during oogenesis. We estimated that 1 g of horseshoe crab eggs could contain approximately 426 to 840 microplastic particles, suggesting that shorebirds feeding on this resource could be ingesting a substantial burden of microplastics during their migratory stopover, much of which appears to be retained by shorebirds, rather than being eliminated in their fecal pellets.",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114148,
212,Analysis of the topological motifs of the cellular structure of the tri-spine horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) and its associated mechanical properties.,"Yaopeng Ma, Ce Guo, Jingyu Shen, Yu Wang",2022,"Topological motifs in pore architecture can profoundly influence the structural properties of that architecture, such as its mass, porosity, modulus, strength, and surface permeability. Taking the irregular cellular structure of the tri-spine horseshoe crab as a research model, we present a new approach to the quantitative description and analysis of structure-property-function relationships. We employ a robust skeletonization method to construct a curve-skeleton that relies on high-resolution 3D tomographic data. The topological motifs and mechanical properties of the long-range cellular structure were investigated using the Grasshopper plugin and uniaxial compression test to identify the variation gradient. Finite element analysis was conducted for the sub-volumes to obtain the variation in effective modulus along the three principal directions. The results show that the branch length and node distribution density varied from the tip to the base of the sharp corner. These node types formed a low-connectivity network, in which the node types 3-N and 4-N tended to follow the motifs of ideal planar triangle and tetrahedral configurations, respectively, with the highest proportion of inter-branch angles in the angle ranges of 115-120° and 105-110°. In addition, mapping the mechanical gradients to topological properties indicated that narrower profiles with a given branch length gradient, preferred branch orientation, and network connectedness degree are the main factors that affect the mechanical properties. These factors suggest significant potential for designing a controllable, irregularly cellular structure in terms of both morphology and function.",10.1088/1748-3190/ac9207,

In this work, the proteins of the lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated and non-stimulated hemocytes of Malaysian Tachypleus gigas were profiled using LC-MS/MS. A total of 154 proteins were identified in both types of samples. Additionally, seventy-seven proteins were commonly found in both conditions, while 52 and 25 proteins were uniquely found in the LPS-stimulated and non-stimulated hemocytes, respectively. ATP-dependent energy-generating proteins such as actins and BLTX actin-related proteins were detected in both stimulated and non-stimulated T. gigas hemocytes, but more of such proteins were found in the former type. Proteins such as tachylectin-2, coagulogen, c-reactive proteins, histones, hemocyanin, and DNA polymerase, which play key roles in the organism's innate immunity, were differentially expressed in the hemocytes following LPS challenge. In conclusion, the proteins identified in the hemolymph of T. gigas are vital for the organism's molecular functions, biological processes, and activation of innate immunity.",10.1371/journal.pone.0272799,
214,"Effect of Intertidal Elevation at Tsuyazaki Cove, Fukuoka, Japan on Survival Rate of Horseshoe Crab Tachypleus tridentatus Eggs.","Shinji Itaya, Mari Shuuno, Norio Onikura, Akira Tai, Shinichiro Yano",2022,"Physical factors affecting the survival of Tachypleus tridentatus eggs were investigated by translocating their eggs between the high intertidal zone and the low intertidal zone of a known spawning site. The mean egg survival rates per day were highest in the mid intertidal zone (45.1%±25.4%) and the lowest in the low intertidal zone (13.3%±27.6%). Differences in the elevation, air exposure time, and water content of the spawning ground were significant factors determining the egg survival rates. Excessive or insufficient air exposure time resulted in inadequate water content at higher and lower intertidal zones and could reduce egg survival. On the other hand, moderate saturation and dehydration were repeated with each tidal movement in the mid intertidal zone. This dynamic is considered as one of the crucial factors for the survival of eggs and is considered optimal for spawning. Therefore, the protection of the mid intertidal zone is imperative for maximizing the egg survival rate in Tsuyazaki Cove where almost all suitable nesting sites have disappeared due to coastal development. By protecting these optimal sites for spawning and recovering other optimal sites on suitable beaches, a positive contribution can be made to future management and conservation. The study also suggests that translocating eggs from marginal to optimal spawning sites might be a recovery strategy for this globally endangered species.",10.1007/s11802-022-5357-8,

Asian horseshoe crabs are ecologically important macroinvertebrates in coastal and estuarine ecosystems. However, their spawning habitat studies were limited to several reports in tropical regions, possibly due to the lack of modified survey methods, particularly in habitats with a lower density of spawning adults, and/or intermingled with anthropogenic structures. In this study, the year-round egg distribution and spawning habitat baselines of Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda and Tachypleus tridentatus were determined in the northern Beibu Gulf, China. Our findings demonstrated that the peak spawning occurred in June-July and ceased in November-January when the average water temperature dropped below 20 °C. Egg aggregations were found < 10 cm beneath the sediment surface with regular tidal inundation, regardless of seasonal changes, in the vicinity of natural and artificial structures with elevated, mildly sloping substratum within the high tide zones. The nests were characterized by medium-sized sediment grains (0.5-0.9 mm), high temperatures (31-34°C), low water contents (0.8%-0.9%), and total organic carbon contents (0.5%-0.7%), which might maximize the hatching success. The identified nesting beaches were close to nursery habitats for juveniles, and tidal creeks were present as the possible corridor connecting these two important habitats through the dominant mangrove forests. The findings provide valuable insights in the scope of spawning behavior and nest-site selection of Asian horseshoe crabs under a mixture of natural and artificial structures, which could benefit future management efforts for the exploited spawning populations.",10.1007/s11802-022-5164-2,

To explore suitable feed for animals during the breeding season, Pacific oyster (Ostrea gigas) (oyster group; OG) and frozen sharpbelly fish (Hemiculter leucisculus) (frozen fish group; FG) were selected to feed 20 T. tridentatus male and female pairs, respectively. At the end of the experiment, intestinal samples were obtained to measure digestive enzymes activities. The intestinal flora were determined by 16S rDNA sequencing. No eggs were observed in the FG and one T. tridentatus adult died. No animals died in the OG, and 9.7 × 104 eggs were obtained. These results show that oysters are more suitable for the development and reproduction of adult T. tridentatus than frozen fish. Additionally, the digestive enzyme activity analysis revealed that animals in the OG exhibited higher protein digestibility than those in the FG, but no significant differences in lipid and carbohydrate uptake were observed between the groups. Furthermore, the intestinal flora analysis showed that operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the Chao1 index were significantly higher in the OG than in the FG, but no significant difference was observed in the Shannon or Simpson indices between the groups. Our data indicate that the oyster diet improved the intestinal microbial diversity of T. tridentatus. We hypothesize that nutrients, such as oyster-based taurine, proteins, and highly unsaturated fatty acids, improve protease activity in the T. tridentatus digestive tract, alter the intestinal floral structure, and improve the reproductive performance of T. tridentatus.",10.1007/s11802-022-5199-4,

A novel antimicrobial peptide, termed Tatritin, was identified and characterized in hemolymph of Chinese horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus, infected with Gram-negative bacteria via transcriptome analysis. Tatritin was significantly induced by bacterial infection in hemolymph and gill. The preprotein of Tatritin consists of a signal peptide (21 aa) and a mature peptide (47 aa) enriched by cysteine. The putative mature peptide was 5.6 kDa with a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 9.99 and showed a α-helix structure in the N-terminal and an anti-parallel β-sheet structure in the cysteine-stabilized C-terminal region. The chemically synthesized peptide of Tatritin exhibited a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. Furthermore, Tatritin may recognize and inhibit pathogenic microorganisms by directly binding to LPS, DNA, and chitin. In addition, administration of Tatritin reduced the mortality of zebrafish after bacterial infection. Due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vivo and in vitro and the sensitivity to drug-resistant bacterial strains, Tatritin peptide can be used as a new type of drug for infection treatment or as an immune enhancer in animals.",10.3389/fimmu.2022.794779,

In this study, we performed transcriptome gene expression profiling of four continuous embryonic stages (Stages 18-21) and first instar larvae of Tachypleus tridentatus. A mean of 50,742,995 high-quality clean reads was obtained from each library. We then conducted weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) for 13,698 genes with fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments values >5. We identified 17 modules, six of which likely play critical roles in development. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed on the biologically significant modules. We found that several pathways, such as hedgehog signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, dorso-ventral axis formation, may be involved in the embryonic development process of T. tridentatus. We also identified hub genes that were highly connected in the six critical modules. This is the first study to apply WGCNA to horseshoe crabs to identify hub genes that may play critical roles in development, and our results provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying early development in horseshoe crabs.",10.1016/j.cbd.2022.100980,

The tri-spine horseshoe crab (HSC) Tachypleus tridentatus has been facing the threat of population depletion for decades, and the effects of OA on the physiology and microbiology of its early life stage are unclear. In this study, the 1st instar HSC larvae were exposed to acidified seawater (pH 7.3, pH 8.1 as control) for 28 days to determine the effects of OA on their growth, molting, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota. Results showed that there were no significant differences in growth index and molting rate between OA group and control group, but the chitinase activity, β-NAGase activity, and ecdysone content in OA group were significantly lower than those of the control group. Compared to the control group, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in OA group were significantly increased at the end of the experiment. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities increased first and then decreased, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) decreased first and then increased, and GST activity changed little during the experiment. According to the result of 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota, microbial-mediated functions predicted by PICRUSt showed that ""Hematopoietic cell lineage,"" ""Endocytosis,"" ""Staphylococcus aureus infection,"" and ""Shigellosis"" pathways significantly increased in OA group. The above results indicate that OA had no significant effect on growth index and molting rate but interfered with the activity of chitinolytic enzymes and ecdysone expression of juvenile horseshoe crabs, and caused oxidative stress. In addition, OA had adverse effects on the immune defense function and intestinal health. The present study reveals the potential threat of OA to T. tridentatus population and lays a foundation for the further study of the physiological adaptation mechanism of juvenile horseshoe crabs to environmental change.",10.3389/fphys.2021.813582,

In addition to classic intracellular pathogens, other bacteria including uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) can adopt both extracellular and intracellular lifestyles. UPEC intracellular survival and replication complicates treatment, as many therapeutic molecules do not effectively reach all components of the infection cycle. In this study, we explored cell-penetrating antimicrobial peptides from distinct structural classes as alternative molecules for targeting bacteria. We identified two β-hairpin peptides from the horseshoe crab, tachyplesin I and polyphemusin I, with broad antimicrobial activity toward a panel of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in planktonic form. Peptide analogs [I11A]tachyplesin I and [I11S]tachyplesin I maintained activity toward bacteria, but were less toxic to mammalian cells than native tachyplesin I. This important increase in therapeutic window allowed treatment with higher concentrations of [I11A]tachyplesin I and [I11S]tachyplesin I, to significantly reduce intramacrophage survival of UPEC in an in vitro infection model. Mechanistic studies using bacterial cells, model membranes and cell membrane extracts, suggest that tachyplesin I and polyphemusin I peptides kill UPEC by selectively binding and disrupting bacterial cell membranes. Moreover, treatment of UPEC with sublethal peptide concentrations increased zinc toxicity and enhanced innate macrophage antimicrobial pathways. In summary, our combined data show that cell-penetrating peptides are attractive alternatives to traditional small molecule antibiotics for treating UPEC infection, and that optimization of native peptide sequences can deliver effective antimicrobials for targeting bacteria in extracellular and intracellular environments.",10.1007/s00018-021-04041-z,

The naturally occurring spatial variation in the mechanical properties of the carapace cuticle need to be investigated to understand their regulatory mechanism and the underlying design strategies. In this work, we used a combination of high-resolution optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to evaluate the multiscale microstructure and elemental composition of the cuticle of tri-spine horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus). The moduli, ultimate strengths, and failure strains of the three individual layers and the entire cuticle were systematically characterized in both the dry and hydrated states. The failure behaviors and energy absorption of the cuticle involved stress stiffening, toughness mechanism and environmental adaptation were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and then correlated with the morphological features in different cuticle regions. The mechanical properties are primarily influenced by the endocuticle thickness ratio; a higher thickness ratio corresponds to more stacking of the vertical lamellae, leading to a lower modulus, weaker strength, and greater elongation of the endocuticle. Radial energy is absorbed primarily by the endocuticle, with the energy absorbed in the radial direction being nearly twice that absorbed in the circumferential direction. This is attributed to the larger failure strain and relatively small decrease in the stress plateau in the radial direction. The findings provide a deeper understanding of how nature modulates the cuticle's mechanical properties and inspiration for developing high-performance synthetic composites.",10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104954,

Total hemocyte counts varied widely (RI 6600-44 300/µL). Electrolytes were consistent with osmoconformers living in seawater. There was a marked difference in sexes, with females showing much lower protein, glucose, and copper levels. Eleven females had multiple outliers, and all data were excluded from RI calculations.

In the case of the American horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus), sediment conditions along estuarine shorelines influence development rates and embryonic viability. Sandy beach habitats are considered to have optimal conditions for horseshoe crab embryonic development; however, spawning is often observed outside of these optimal habitats, in areas such as salt marshes, where reduced oxygen availability is thought to decrease the viability of eggs laid in these sediments. We excavated horseshoe crab eggs, embryos, and trilobites laid naturally in marsh and beach sediments in South Carolina to compare their development and viability between habitats. We found all developmental stages in both marsh and beach habitats. For two of three sampling areas, trilobites were more likely to be found at beaches than at marshes. Multivariate analyses demonstrate that the prevalence of early and middle developmental stages was similar between habitats but that beaches had a greater proportion of late-stage trilobites than marshes. The lower likelihood of finding trilobites at some marshes may reflect differences in spawning phenology between habitats or reduced rates of embryonic development in marshes compared to beaches, leading to potentially different developmental timelines rather than a true reduction in viability. Nevertheless, the substantial proportions of eggs laid in salt marshes that survive to the trilobite stage indicate that spawning in this habitat could represent a previously underappreciated source of recruitment for horseshoe crab populations that may need to be incorporated into population assessments.",10.1086/714277,

232,"The Beneficial Effects of Edible Kynurenic Acid from Marine Horseshoe Crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) on Obesity, Hyperlipidemia, and Gut Microbiota in High-Fat Diet-Fed Mice.","Jian Li, Yaqi Zhang, Shen Yang, Zhenhua Lu, Guiling Li, Shangyi Wu, Da-Ren Wu, Jingwen Liu, Bo Zhou, Hui-Min David Wang, Shi-Ying Huang",2021,"The marine horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) has been considered as food and traditional medicine for many years. Kynurenic acid (KA) was isolated from horseshoe crab in this study for the first time in the world. A previous study in 2018 reported that intraperitoneal administration of KA prevented high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced body weight gain. Now, we investigated the effects of intragastric gavage of KA on HFD mice and found that KA (5 mg/kg/day) inhibited both the body weight gain and the increase of average daily energy intake. KA reduced serum triglyceride and increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. KA inhibited HFD-induced the increases of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, coronary artery risk index, and atherosclerosis index. KA also suppressed HFD-induced the increase of the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (two dominant gut microbial phyla). KA partially reversed HFD-induced the changes in the composition of gut microbial genera. These overall effects of KA on HFD mice were similar to that of simvastatin (positive control). But the effects of 1.25 mg/kg/day KA on HFD-caused hyperlipidemia were similar to the effects of 5 mg/kg/day simvastatin. The pattern of relative abundance in 40 key genera of gut microbiota from KA group was closer to that from the normal group than that from the simvastatin group. In addition, our in vitro results showed the potential antioxidant activity of KA, which suggests that the improvement effects of KA on HFD mice may be partially associated with antioxidant activity of KA. Our findings demonstrate the potential role of KA as a functional food ingredient for the treatment of obesity and hyperlipidemia as well as the modulation of gut microbiota.",10.1155/2021/8874503,
233,A mutant equipped with a regenerated disulphide for the missing His loop of a serine protease zymogen in the horseshoe crab coagulation cascade.,"Keisuke Yamashita, Naoki Takeshita, Aina Arita, Toshio Shibata, Yuki Kobayashi, Shun-Ichiro Kawabata",2021,"The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered coagulation cascade in horseshoe crabs is composed of three zymogens belonging to the trypsinogen family: prochelicerase C, prochelicerase B (proB) and the proclotting enzyme (proCE). Trypsinogen-family members contain three conserved disulphides located around the active site. While it is known that proB evolutionarily lost one of the disulphides, the His-loop disulphide, the roles of the missing His-loop disulphide in proB remain unknown. Here, we prepared a proB mutant, named proB-murasame, equipped with a regenerated His-loop disulphide. The activation rate by upstream α-chelicerase C for proB-murasame was indistinguishable from that for wild-type (WT) proB. The resulting protease chelicerase B-murasame exhibited an 8-fold higher kcat value for downstream proCE than WT chelicerase B, whereas the Km value of chelicerase B-murasame was equivalent to that of WT chelicerase B. WT serpins-1, -2 and -3, identified as scavengers for the cascade, had no reactivity against WT chelicerase B, whereas chelicerase B-murasame was inhibited by WT serpin-2, suggesting that WT chelicerae B may trigger as-yet-unsolved phenomena after performing its duty in the cascade. The reconstituted LPS-triggered cascade containing proB-murasame exhibited ∼5-fold higher CE production than that containing WT proB. ProB-murasame might be used as a high value-adding reagent for LPS detection.",10.1093/jb/mvab064,

As a kind of living fossil species, the pathogen defenses of horseshoe crabs entirely depend on the innate immune system. Although, there are abundant immune molecules found in the horseshoe crab hemolymph, the biological mechanisms underlying their abilities of distinguishing and defending against invading microbes are still unclear. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing at mRNA and protein levels and bioinformatics analysis methods to systematically analyze the innate immune response to Gram-negative bacteria in hemolymph of Chinese horseshoe crab. These results showed that many genes in the complement and coagulation cascades, Toll, NF-κB, C-type lectin receptor, JAK-STAT, and MAPK signaling pathways, and antimicrobial substances were activated at 12 and 24 h post-infection, suggesting that Gram-negative bacteria could activate the hemolymph coagulation cascade and antibacterial substances release via the above pathways. In addition, we conjectured that Toll and NF-κB signaling pathway were most likely to participate in the immune response to Gram-negative bacteria in hemolymph of horseshoe crab through an integral signal cascade. These findings will provide a useful reference for exploring the ancient original innate immune mechanism.",10.3389/fimmu.2020.584808,

Consequently, the WGD that occurred in the common ancestor of horseshoe crabs ~135 million years ago provides a rare opportunity to decipher the evolutionary consequences of a duplicated invertebrate genome. Here, we present a high-quality genome assembly for the mangrove horseshoe crab Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda (1.7 Gb, N50 = 90.2 Mb, with 89.8% sequences anchored to 16 pseudomolecules, 2n = 32), and a resequenced genome of the tri-spine horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus (1.7 Gb, N50 = 109.7 Mb). Analyses of gene families, microRNAs, and synteny show that horseshoe crabs have undergone three rounds (3R) of WGD. Comparison of C. rotundicauda and T. tridentatus genomes from populations from several geographic locations further elucidates the diverse fates of both coding and noncoding genes. Together, the present study represents a cornerstone for improving our understanding of invertebrate WGD events on the evolutionary fates of genes and microRNAs, at both the individual and population level.

The basic structure, function, and physiology of these invertebrates and their internal organs are not well documented in the literature. In this study, the gastrointestinal system, with a focus on the stomach, of adult L. polyphemus were assessed by gross and histologic methods to further characterize the pyloric valve, the lining of the ventricular lumen, and the muscular tunics of the stomach. Determination of normal anatomical structure of this organ system, along with characterization of the esophagus and intestinal tract, will set a standard against which tissue abnormalities, such as those seen with disease or pathology were to arise, would allow for better interpretation.",10.1007/s00441-020-03404-5,

With the aim of obtaining an alternative chitosan supply, the carapace of dead horseshoe crabs seemed feasible. This sparked an investigation of the structural changes and antioxidant capacity of horseshoe crab chitosan (HCH) by γ-irradiation using 60Co source. Chitosan was extracted from the horseshoe crab (Tachypleus gigas; Müller) carapace using heterogeneous chemical N-deacetylation of chitin, followed by the irradiation of HCH using 60Co at a dose-dependent rate of 10 kGy/hour. The average molecular weight was determined by the viscosimetric method. Regarding the chemical properties, the crystal-like structures obtained from γ-irradiated chitosan powders were determined using Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. The change in chitosan structure was evident with dose-dependent rates between 10 and 20 kGy/hour. The antioxidant properties of horseshoe crab-derived chitosan were evaluated in vitro. The 20 kGy γ-irradiation applied to chitosan changed the structure and reduced the molecular weight, providing sufficient degradation for an increase in antioxidant activity. Our findings indicate that horseshoe crab chitosan can be employed for both scald-wound healing and long-term food preservation due to its buffer-like and radical ion scavenging ability.",10.3390/polym12102361,

A Review.,"Jay Bolden, Chris Knutsen, Jack Levin, Catherine Milne, Tina Morris, Ned Mozier, Ingo Spreitzer, Friedrich von Wintzingerode",2020,"Endotoxin testing by recombinant factor C (rFC) is increasing with the addition of new suppliers of reagents. By use of a recombinantly produced factor C , based on the sequence of a coagulation enzyme present in horseshoe crab amebocyte lysates, the rFC tests are designed as substitutes for the traditional Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL)/Tachypleus amebocyte lysate tests based on horseshoe crab blood. Comparative testing of samples with both the LAL and recombinant reagents has shown a high degree of correlation, suggesting that use of rFC is comparable to the more traditional LAL tests and may be technologically superior. Recombinant factor C does not recognize the factor G pathway, the alternate coagulation pathway that the lysate reagents detect. This feature allows rFC to detect endotoxin more selectively. As a recombinantly produced material, it avoids the use of the horseshoe crabs required for lysate production, thereby protecting this species, which is at risk in some parts of the world. Recombinant factor C is expected to further benefit from a more sustainable supply chain based upon a robust biotechnological production process. We summarize here the results of many studies that evaluated the use of recombinant technology for the detection of environmental endotoxin. Additionally, we include a review of the current compendia and regulatory status of the recombinant technologies for use in the quality control of pharmaceutical manufacturing. Our analysis confirms that the recombinant technologies are comparable in protecting patient safety.",10.5731/pdajpst.2020.012187,

Activities such as locomotion and foraging behaviour of sediment-dwelling species, however, may be hindered in the presence of the obstacles. In this study, collected field evidence demonstrated that habitat utilization of the juvenile tri-spine horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus, an iconic and endangered macroinvertebrate, was adversely affected by high-density intertidal oyster rubble zones. Despite the fact that the utilization area of individual juvenile horseshoe crabs was independent of the presence of these obstacles, the abundance and number of positional fixes of tagged juveniles in these areas were lower. The effects of these obstacles and their associated topographic changes on the movement of the juvenile horseshoe crabs was investigated in a simulated laboratory experiment. Both the simulated oyster cultches and hummocks formed between the cultches reduced the total distance and displacement of the feeding trail, and less juveniles preferred to forage on elevated, dry hummocks (dry at low tide) formed between the cultches. Our findings suggested that oyster cultches and rubbles reduced the habitat quality for juvenile horseshoe crabs. On-bottom oyster cultivation activities seeking to conserve horseshoe cabs by avoiding nursery habitats should instead consider off-bottom or offshore cultivation methods.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110925,

However, their existence is now under threat because of anthropogenic activities. The availability of genomic resources for these species will be valuable in planning appropriate conservation measures. Whole-genome sequences are currently available for three species. In this study, we have generated a chromosome-level genome assembly of the fourth species, the Asian coastal horseshoe crab (Tachypleus gigas; genome size 2.0 Gb). The genome assembly has a scaffold N50 value of 140 Mb with ~97% of the assembly mapped to 14 scaffolds representing 14 chromosomes of T. gigas. In addition, we have generated the complete mitochondrial genome sequence and deep-coverage transcriptome assemblies for four tissues. A total of 26,159 protein-coding genes were predicted in the genome. The T. gigas genome contains five Hox clusters similar to the mangrove horseshoe crab (Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda), suggesting that the common ancestor of horseshoe crabs already possessed five Hox clusters. Phylogenomic and divergence time analysis suggested that the American and Asian horseshoe crab lineages shared a common ancestor around the Silurian period (~436 Ma). Comparison of the T. gigas genome with those of other horseshoe crab species with chromosome-level assemblies provided insights into the chromosomal rearrangement events that occurred during the emergence of these species. The genomic resources of T. gigas will be useful for understanding their genetic diversity and population structure and would help in designing strategies for managing and conserving their stocks across Asia.",10.1111/1755-0998.13233,

Therefore, identifying and synthesizing novel peptides could provide a promising option for cancer patients. The antitumour second generation peptide, CIGB-552 has been developed as a candidate for cancer therapy. Proteomic and genomic studies have identified the intracellular protein COMMD1 as the specific target of CIGB-552. This peptide penetrates to the inside tumour cells to induce the proteasomal degradation of RelA, causing the termination of NF-κB signalling. The antitumour activity of CIGB-552 has been validated in vitro in different human cancer cell lines, as well as in vivo in syngeneic and xenograft tumour mouse models and in dogs with different types of cancers. The aim of this review is to present and discuss the experimental data obtained on the action of CIGB-552, including its mechanism of action and its therapeutic potential in human chronic diseases.

243,Post-translational protein deimination signatures and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the Atlantic horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus).,"Timothy J Bowden, Igor Kraev, Sigrun Lange",2020,"The horseshoe crab is a living fossil and a species of marine arthropod with unusual immune system properties which are also exploited commercially. Given its ancient status dating to the Ordovician period (450 million years ago), its standing in phylogeny and unusual immunological characteristics, the horseshoe crab may hold valuable information for comparative immunology studies. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are calcium dependent enzymes that are phylogenetically conserved and cause protein deimination via conversion of arginine to citrulline. This post-translational modification can lead to structural and functional protein changes contributing to protein moonlighting in health and disease. PAD-mediated regulation of extracellular vesicle (EV) release, a critical component of cellular communication, has furthermore been identified to be a phylogenetically conserved mechanism. PADs, protein deimination and EVs have hitherto not been studied in the horseshoe crab and were assessed in the current study. Horseshoe crab haemolymph serum-EVs were found to be a poly-dispersed population in the 20-400 nm size range, with the majority of EVs falling within 40-123 nm. Key immune proteins were identified to be post-translationally deiminated in horseshoe crab haemolymph serum, providing insights into protein moonlighting function of Limulus and phylogenetically conserved immune proteins. KEGG (Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes) and GO (gene ontology) enrichment analysis of deiminated proteins identified in Limulus revealed KEGG pathways relating to complement and coagulation pathways, Staphylococcus aureus infection, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and carbon metabolism, while GO pathways of biological and molecular pathways related to a range of immune and metabolic functions, as well as developmental processes. The characterisation of EVs, and post-translational deimination signatures, revealed here in horseshoe crab, contributes to current understanding of protein moonlighting functions and EV-mediated communication in this ancient arthropod and throughout phylogeny.",10.1016/j.dci.2020.103714,

However, the genetic mechanisms underlying their abilities of distinguishing and defending against invading microbes are still unclear. Here, we describe the 2.06 Gbp genome assembly of Tachypleus tridentatus with 24,222 predicted protein-coding genes. Comparative genomics shows that T. tridentatus and the Atlantic horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus have the most orthologues shared among two species, including genes involved in the immune-related JAK-STAT signalling pathway. Divergence time dating results show that the last common ancestor of Asian horseshoe crabs (including T. tridentatus and C. rotundicauda) and L. polyphemus appeared approximately 130 Mya (121-141), and the split of the two Asian horseshoe crabs was dated to approximately 63 Mya (57-69). Hox gene analysis suggests two clusters in both horseshoe crab assemblies. Surprisingly, selective analysis of immune-related gene families revealed the high expansion of conserved pattern recognition receptors. Genes involved in the IMD and JAK-STAT signal transduction pathways also exhibited a certain degree of expansion in both genomes. Intact coagulation cascade-related genes were present in the T. tridentatus genome with a higher number of coagulation factor genes. Moreover, most reported antibacterial peptides have been identified in T. tridentatus with their potentially effective antimicrobial sites. The draft genome of T. tridentatus would provide important evidence for further clarifying the taxonomy and evolutionary relationship of Chelicerata. The expansion of conserved immune signalling pathway genes, coagulation factors and intact antimicrobial peptides in T. tridentatus constitutes its robust and effective innate immunity for self-defence in marine environments with an enormous number of invading pathogens and may affect the quality of the adaptive properties with regard to complicated marine environments.",10.1186/s12864-020-6488-1,

Thus, this study aimed to determine antimicrobial activities of hemocyanin subunit IIIA and to identify the best activator of this protein. The hemocyanin was partially purified using spin column affinity, its fraction was applied to Hi-Prep Sephacryl Exclusion 26/60 2-200 HR column, followed by Hi-Prep 26/10 Desalting Column on fast protein liquid chromatography. The purity of hemocyanin was validated by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight/Mass Spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity was performed by Disc Diffusion Test. Purified hemocyanin subunit IIIA was identified to have a molecular weight of 72.9 kDa. SDS was found to be the best activator of hemocyanin, as indicated by elevated level of phenoloxidase. As for antimicrobial activity, hemocyanin was minimally inhibited by all bacteria strains tested (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae), with relatively lower Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) at 0.005 g mL-1, than recorded MIC for fungal test strains. Two fungal strains (Penicillium sp. and A. niger) show susceptible response to phenoloxidase using MgSO4 as inducer. Whereas, lysate-treated CaCl2 induced susceptibility only to A. niger. Hemocyanin shows better antimicrobial activity than phenoloxidase because of its broad-spectrum activity against bacterial and fungal strains tested.

Backbone cyclized TI (cTI) has similar anticancer properties to TI but has higher stability and lower hemolytic activity. We designed and synthesized cTI analogues to further improve anticancer potential and investigated structure-activity relationships based on peptide-membrane interactions, cellular uptake, and anticancer activity. The membrane-binding affinity and cytotoxic activity of cTI were found to be highly dependent on peptide hydrophobicity and charge. We describe two analogues with increased selectivity toward melanoma cells and one analogue with the ability to enter cells with high efficacy and low toxicity. Overall, the structure-activity relationship study shows that cTI can be developed as a membrane-active antimelanoma lead, or be employed as a cell penetrating peptide scaffold that can target and enter cells without damaging their integrity.",10.1021/acschembio.9b00782,

In South Carolina, some HSCs are held in outdoor ponds before transport to facilities where they are bled and then released to the wild. This study examined whether the time HSCs are held before bleeding, bleeding itself, or the duration of the recovery after bleeding affects HSC mortality and physiological condition. Female HSCs were collected from Coffin Point Beach, South Carolina (April 22-24, 2016), held in ponds for 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks, then bled or held as controls. Body weights, hemocyanin concentrations, and hemocyte densities were measured prior to treatment (bled/control) and at 2, 6, and 12 days of recovery. Hemocyanin concentrations declined significantly in HSCs held in ponds for 8 weeks prior to bleeding and were excluded from further analyses. Compared to some studies, HSC mortalities were low (11%). Impacts of time in holding ponds, bleeding, and recovery from bleeding on physiological measures were assessed using 3-way fixed-effects ANOVA. While duration of recovery had main effects on physiological measures, significant interactions were also present. There was an interaction of treatment and recovery duration, with control crabs having higher hemocyte densities than bled animals at days 2 and 6 of recovery. There were two significant two-way interactions influencing hemocyanin concentration: pond time and recovery, and treatment and recovery. Our study suggests both main and synergistic effects are important when assessing the physiology and mortality of HSCs harvested for biomedical purposes.",10.1016/j.cbpa.2019.110554,
248,Lift and Drag Acting on the Shell of the American Horseshoe Crab (Limulus polyphemus).,"Alexander L Davis, Alexander P Hoover, Laura A Miller",2019,"The intertidal zone is a turbulent landscape where organisms face numerous mechanical challenges from powerful waves. A model for understanding the solutions to these physical problems, the American horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus), is a marine arthropod that mates in the intertidal zone, where it must contend with strong ambient flows to maintain its orientation during locomotion and reproduction. Possible strategies to maintain position include either negative lift generation or the minimization of positive lift in flow. To quantify flow over the shell and the forces generated, we laser-scanned the 3D shape of a horseshoe crab, and the resulting digital reconstruction was used to 3D-print a physical model. We then recorded the movement of tracking particles around the shell model with high-speed video and analyzed the time-lapse series using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The velocity vector fields from PIV were used to validate numerical simulations performed with the immersed boundary (IB) method. IB simulations allowed us to resolve the forces acting on the shell, as well as the local three-dimensional flow velocities and pressures. Both IB simulations and PIV analysis of vorticity and velocity at a flow speed of 13 cm/s show negative lift for negative and zero angles of attack, and positive lift for positive angles of attack in a free-stream environment. In shear flow simulations, we found near-zero lift for all orientations tested. Because horseshoe crabs are likely to be found primarily at near-zero angles of attack, we suggest that this negative lift helps maintain the orientation of the crab during locomotion and mating. This study provides a preliminary foundation for assessing the relationship between documented morphological variation and potential environmental variation for distinct populations of horseshoe crabs along the Atlantic Coast. It also motivates future studies which could consider the stability of the horseshoe crab in unsteady, oscillating flows.",10.1007/s11538-019-00657-2,

None of the materials were superior with regards to holding nor was there any dehiscence. Nylon evoked the least amount of tissue reaction.

250,On the appendicular anatomy of the xiphosurid Tachypleus syriacus and the evolution of fossil horseshoe crab appendages.,"Russell D C Bicknell, Tom Brougham, Sylvain Charbonnier, Frédéric Sautereau, Tomaž Hitij, Nicolás E Campione",2019,"Xiphosurida-crown group horseshoe crabs-are a group of morphologically conservative marine chelicerates (at least since the Jurassic). They represent an idealised example of evolutionary stasis. Unfortunately, body fossils of horseshoe crabs seldom preserve appendages and their associated features; thus, an important aspect of their morphology is absent in explorations of their conservative Bauplan. As such, fossil horseshoe crab appendages are rarely considered within a comparative framework: previous comparisons have focussed almost exclusively on extant taxa to the exclusion of extinct taxa. Here, we examine eight specimens of the xiphosurid Tachypleus syriacus (Woodward, 1879) from the Cenomanian (ca 100 Ma) Konservat-Lagerstätten of Lebanon, five of which preserve the cephalothoracic and thoracetronic appendages in exceptional detail. Comparing these appendages of T. syriacus with other fossil xiphosurids highlights the conserved nature of appendage construction across Xiphosurida, including examples of Austrolimulidae, Paleolimulidae, and Limulidae. Conversely, Belinuridae have more elongate cephalothoracic appendages relative to body length. Differences in appendage sizes are likely related to the freshwater and possible subaerial life modes of belinurids, contrasting with the primarily marine habits of other families. The morphological similarity of T. syriacus to extant members of the genus indicates that the conserved nature of the generic lineage can be extended to ecological adaptations, notably burrowing, swimming, possible diet, and sexual dimorphism.",10.1007/s00114-019-1629-6,

Most previous studies on the impacts of the biomedical bleeding process on horseshoe crabs have focused on mortality rates and sublethal impacts in the laboratory. In this study, we investigated the effects of the bleeding process on the behavior of horseshoe crabs after they had been released back into their natural environment. A total of 28 horseshoe crabs (14 control and 14 bled) were fitted with acoustic transmitters and released into the Great Bay Estuary, New Hampshire, during the spring of 2016. The acoustic tags transmitted information about the activity and depth of each animal, and these data were logged by an array of passive acoustic receivers. These data were collected from May to December 2016 and from March to October 2017. Bled animals approached mating beaches less than control animals during the first week after release, with the greatest differences between bled and control females. Bled animals also remained significantly deeper during the spawning season than control animals. However, overall, bled and control animals expressed similar biological rhythms and seasonal migrations. Thus, it appears as if the most obvious impacts of the bleeding process take place during the first one to two weeks after crabs are bled.",10.1086/702917,

Three types of hemocytes were distinguished respectively: the granular cell, the semi-granular cell and the hyaline cell by transmission electron microscopy, while three hemocyte subpopulations (Gate 1 cell, Gate 2 cell, Gate 3 cell) were classified by flow cytometry. Hyaline cell was the major cell type with the highest nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and granular cell and semi-granular cell showed lower ratios. Immune parameters of hemocytes in horseshoe crabs were investigated by flow cytometry. Different hemocyte subpopulations respond for diverse functions. Lysosomal contents and hemocyte mortality in Gate 3 cell subpopulation were higher than that in other subpopulations, while reactive oxygen species, phagocytosis and non-specific esterase, in Gate 1 cell subpopulation, were higher than those in other subpopulations. The hemocyte types between the two species had no significant differences in staining or morphology.",10.1038/s41598-019-43630-8,

Neglected as research candidate because of inaccessible spawning grounds, smaller size and less commercial value than T. gigas and also, difficulty to attain from the wild has made C. rotundicauda population status remaining unidentified at Balok. This standpoint drove the present attempt because anthropic activities like structure placement and mining are point-source for runoffs that load sediments into Balok River. While erosion-accretion events have altered Balok River width, the shore sediments in Balok Beach were transitioned between medium-fine and fine sand between years 2012 and 2016. Eventually by year 2016, the C. rotundicauda were depositing 5117 eggs in 91 nests from 200 to 1000 m range along this corridor facing South China Sea. From this yield, C. rotundicauda released 2880 eggs in 56 nests during the Southwest monsoon, 1254 eggs in 19 nests during the Northeast monsoon and 983 eggs in 16 nests during the Inter-monsoon seasons. Though female C. rotundicauda opted to lay their eggs in shallow burrows at lower shorelines, the absence of erosion and substantial silt and clay (>20%) deposition facilitates C. rotundicauda embryogenesis with brief periods of temperature and salinity shocks during day-time falling tides. This encourages C. rotundicauda to emerge with increasing abundance and carry out bi-monthly spawning at Balok Beach. In short, shore restoration initiatives like systematic boat docking, proper disposal of nets and waste and, periodic fish-catching operations were effectively led by the Balok fisher citizen scientist. This successful community joint-cooperation proves that citizen-led caretaking of degraded beaches offers marine life protection and are practical for coastal area management especially at areas where other oviparous animals such as turtles and crocodiles are harboured.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.12.002,

Polyphemusin III has the amino acid sequence RRGCFRVCYRGFCFQRCR and is homologous to other β-hairpin peptides from the horseshoe crab. Antimicrobial activity of the peptide was evaluated and MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) values were determined. IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values measured toward human cells revealed that polyphemusin III showed a potent cytotoxic activity at concentrations of <10 μM. Polyphemusin III caused fast permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane of human leukemia cells HL-60, which was measured with trypan blue exclusion assay and lactate dehydrogenase-release assay. Flow cytometry experiments for annexin V-FITC/ propidium iodide double staining revealed that the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, did not abrogate disruption of the plasma membrane by polyphemusin III. Our data suggest that polyphemusin III disrupts the plasma membrane integrity and induces cell death that is apparently not related to apoptosis. In comparison to known polyphemusins and tachyplesins, polyphemusin III demonstrates a similar or lower antimicrobial effect, but significantly higher cytotoxicity against human cancer and transformed cells in vitro.",10.3390/md16120466,
257,Saving the horseshoe crab: A synthetic alternative to horseshoe crab blood for endotoxin detection.,"Tom Maloney, Ryan Phelan, Naira Simmons",2018,"Horseshoe crabs have been integral to the safe production of vaccines and injectable medications for the past 40 years. The bleeding of live horseshoe crabs, a process that leaves thousands dead annually, is an ecologically unsustainable practice for all four species of horseshoe crab and the shorebirds that rely on their eggs as a primary food source during spring migration. Populations of both horseshoe crabs and shorebirds are in decline. This study confirms the efficacy of recombinant Factor C (rFC), a synthetic alternative that eliminates the need for animal products in endotoxin detection. Furthermore, our findings confirm that the biomedical industry can achieve a 90% reduction in the use of reagents derived from horseshoe crabs by using the synthetic alternative for the testing of water and other common materials used in the manufacturing process. This represents an extraordinary opportunity for the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries to significantly contribute to the conservation of horseshoe crabs and the birds that depend on them.",10.1371/journal.pbio.2006607,

In American horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus), book gills bear physiologically distinct regions: dorsal and ventral half-lamellae, a central mitochondria-rich area (CMRA) and peripheral mitochondria-poor areas (PMPAs). In the present study, the CMRA and ventral half-lamella exhibited characteristics important for ammonia excretion and/or acid-base regulation, as supported by high expression levels of Rhesus-protein 1 (LpRh-1), cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase (CA-2) and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated K+ channel (HCN) compared with the PMPA and dorsal half-lamella. The half-lamellae displayed remarkable differences; the ventral epithelium was ion-leaky whereas the dorsal counterpart possessed an exceptionally tight epithelium. LpRh-1 was more abundant than Rhesus-protein 2 (LpRh-2) in all investigated tissues, but LpRh-2 was more prevalent in the PMPA than in the CMRA. Ammonia influx associated with high ambient ammonia (HAA) treatment was counteracted by intact animals and complemented by upregulation of branchial CA-2, V-type H+-ATPase (HAT), HCN and LpRh-1 mRNA expression. The dorsal epithelium demonstrated characteristics of active ammonia excretion. However, an influx was observed across the ventral epithelium as a result of the tissue's high ion conductance, although the influx rate was not proportionately high considering the ∼3-fold inwardly directed ammonia gradient. These novel findings suggest a role for the coxal gland in excretion and in the maintenance of hemolymph ammonia regulation under HAA. Hypercapnic exposure induced compensatory respiratory acidosis and partial metabolic depression. Functional differences between the two halves of a branchial lamella may be physiologically beneficial in reducing the backflow of waste products into adjacent lamellae, especially in fluctuating environments where ammonia levels can increase.",10.1242/jeb.151894,

The evolution of their exoskeleton is well documented by fossils, but appendage and soft-tissue preservation is extremely rare. Here we analyse details of appendage and soft-tissue preservation in Yunnanolimulus luopingensis, a Middle Triassic (ca. 244 million years old) horseshoe crab from Yunnan Province, SW China. The remarkable preservation of anatomical details including the chelicerae, five pairs of walking appendages, opisthosomal appendages with book gills, muscles, and fine setae permits comparison with extant horseshoe crabs. The close anatomical similarity between the Middle Triassic horseshoe crabs and their recent analogues documents anatomical conservatism for over 240 million years, suggesting persistence of lifestyle. The occurrence of Carcinoscorpius-type claspers on the first and second walking legs in male individuals of Y. luopingensis indicates that simple chelate claspers in males are plesiomorphic for horseshoe crabs, and the bulbous claspers in Tachypleus and Limulus are derived.",10.1038/s41598-017-13319-x,
260,"Metal Levels in Blood of Three Species of Shorebirds during Stopover on Delaware Bay Reflect Levels in Their Food, Horseshoe Crab Eggs.","Joanna Burger, Nellie Tsipoura, Michael Gochfeld",2017,"Understanding the relationship between metal level in predators and their prey is an important issue, and is usually difficult to determine because animals eat a variety of organisms. However, shorebirds that stop over during spring migration along Delaware Bay (New Jersey) stay for only 2-3 weeks, and eat mainly horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) eggs. In this paper, we examine the relationship between metal levels in horseshoe crab eggs, and blood and feather levels of metals in red knot (Calidris canutus rufa; n = 30), sanderling (Calidris alba; n = 20) and semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla; n = 38) from Delaware Bay. There is a rich literature on metal levels in feathers. For all three species, the levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and mercury in blood were highly correlated with the levels of metals in the eggs of horseshoe crab (17 pooled samples). This indicates that the levels in the blood of these shorebirds quickly reflect levels in their prey (horseshoe crab eggs), while metals in the feathers were not correlated with the levels in eggs. Semipalmated sandpipers had the lowest levels of arsenic in blood and the highest levels of arsenic in feathers, compared to the other species. At Delaware Bay, semipalmated sandpipers have a diet higher in marsh invertebrates than the other species, which may account for the differences. The levels of cadmium and chromium in blood were significantly higher in knots than other species; knots only ate horseshoe crab eggs. For all of the metals except arsenic, the ratio of levels in blood/feathers was similar among species. For arsenic, the ratio of levels in blood/feathers were significantly lower in semipalmated sandpipers than in the other species, by an order of magnitude.",10.3390/toxics5030020,

Given its limited dispersal capabilities and its inability to live outside of the host, we hypothesized a genetic structure that parallels that of its host. We obtained 84 planarian individuals from 19 horseshoe crabs collected from 10 sites from Massachusetts to Florida. We amplified the mitochondrial 16S rRNA and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 and conducted phylogeographic and population genetic analyses, which show a clear and strong genetic break between the populations in the Atlantic and the Gulf coasts. Among the Atlantic populations, two additional, weaker barriers located along Cape Hatteras and Cape Cod restrict gene flow. Even though previous studies have suggested that the populations of the host may be in decline, those of B. candida remain stable, and some even shows signatures of expansion. Our results indicate that the phylogeography of these marine ectocommensal triclads closely mirrors that of its Limulus host, and highlight the challenges to both host and symbiont to genetically connect populations across their distribution.",10.1007/s00227-017-3132-y,

This study investigated the accumulation of Ag, As, Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb in Atlantic horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) pre-spawned eggs, embryos, and developing larvae collected from 5 sites on Long Island, NY and compared these concentrations to that found in sediment, pore water, and overlying water. All investigated elements were detected in embryos and larvae at all sites. Arsenic was found at the highest concentration in each life stage across all 5 sites, followed by Ag, whereas Cd, Hg and Pb concentrations varied between sites. Chromium was not detected in pre-spawned eggs, but was present in embryos and larvae at all sites, however, along with Hg, significantly increased from embryo to larvae at most sites. We conclude that observed accumulation patterns are likely a result of abiotic factors, differences in uptake pathways between life stages and the rate of excretion.

The genome assembly resulted in 7.4 × 105 contigs with N50 of 4,736, while the transcriptome assembly resulted in 9.3 × 104 contigs and N50 of 3,497. Analysis of functional completeness by the identification of putative universal orthologs suggests that the transcriptome has three times more total expected orthologs than the genome. Interestingly, RNA-Seq analysis indicated no statistically significant changes in expression level for any circadian core or accessory gene, but there was significant cycling of several noncircadian transcripts.

264,Maternal transfer of trace elements in the Atlantic horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus).,"Aaron K Bakker, Jessica Dutton, Matthew Sclafani, Nicholas Santangelo",2017,"The maternal transfer of trace elements is a process by which offspring may accumulate trace elements from their maternal parent. Although maternal transfer has been assessed in many vertebrates, there is little understanding of this process in invertebrate species. This study investigated the maternal transfer of 13 trace elements (Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn) in Atlantic horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) eggs and compared concentrations to those in adult leg and gill tissue. For the majority of individuals, all trace elements were transferred, with the exception of Cr, from the female to the eggs. The greatest concentrations on average transferred to egg tissue were Zn (140 µg/g), Cu (47.8 µg/g), and Fe (38.6 µg/g) for essential elements and As (10.9 µg/g) and Ag (1.23 µg/g) for nonessential elements. For elements that were maternally transferred, correlation analyses were run to assess if the concentration in the eggs were similar to that of adult tissue that is completely internalized (leg) or a boundary to the external environment (gill). Positive correlations between egg and leg tissue were found for As, Hg, Se, Mn, Pb, and Ni. Mercury, Mn, Ni, and Se were the only elements correlated between egg and gill tissue. Although, many trace elements were in low concentration in the eggs, we speculate that the higher transfer of essential elements is related to their potential benefit during early development versus nonessential trace elements, which are known to be toxic. We conclude that maternal transfer as a source of trace elements to horseshoe crabs should not be overlooked and warrants further investigation.",10.1007/s10646-016-1739-2,

Eight rhamnoclusters with three or four α(1-3)-rhamnobiosides attached to different central cores, such as methyl gallate, pentaerythritol, and N-Boc Tris, through either an ethylene glycol or a tetraethylene glycol linker, were assembled in two consecutive azide-alkyne cycloaddition click reactions. The synthetic method embraced the preparation of two α(1-3)-rhamnobiosides with different linker arms and their conjugation, in stoichiometric or substoichiometric amounts, to propargyl ether-functionalized tri- or tetravalent scaffolds. A divalent derivative and two self-assembling rhamnobiosides were also prepared. The different architectures and valences of the rhamnoclusters provided an opportunity to evaluate the impact of topology and valency on the binding properties toward rHPL. Inhibitory ELISA data showed that all covalently linked rhamnoclusters could inhibit P. aeruginosa PAO1 recognition activity of rHPL with high efficacy. Trivalent rhamnobiosides showed a stronger inhibitory effect on P. aeruginosa PAO1 binding, and the more flexible clusters on a pentaerythritol or a Tris core were superior to the less flexible methyl gallate-based clusters. Interestingly, the length of the linker arms had a very low impact on the binding ability of the rhamnoclusters. Herein, the two trivalent derivatives on an N-Boc protected Tris central core were the best inhibitors. The self-assembling amphiphilic rhamnobioside derivatives were found to display no multivalent effect.",10.1002/asia.201601162,

For the majority of the sites, all essential trace elements accumulated in the embryos and larvae. However, many of the embryos and larvae at specific sites presented different concentration patterns which had no apparent relationship with the local habitat sediment and water values. Generally, Cu, Fe, and Se sequentially increased from egg stage through larval stages for the majority of sites, while Co, Mn, and Ni only did for a few sites. Zinc also showed an increase across sites from embryo to larval stage, however was the only one to show a decrease in concentration from egg to embryo stage at all sites. Interestingly, Mn at Manhasset Bay presented embryo and larval stages to be 50 fold greater than all other sites while the egg stage showed similar values to other sites; this high degree of uptake could be due to a high concentration in the overlying water. All essential trace elements can be accumulated from the environment but greater concentrations may be influenced by abiotic factors and the predominant uptake route (aqueous versus diet) at each life stage. Future laboratory experiments are required to investigate factors that influence essential trace element accumulation and loss in horseshoe crab early life stages.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.097,

In this study American horseshoe crabs, Limulus polyphemus, were used to test the circalunidian hypothesis by exposing them to four different tidal regimes. Overall, the results obtained support the circalunidian hypothesis: each of the twice-daily rhythms of activity appears to be controlled by a separate clock, each with an endogenous period of approximately 24.8h. First, spontaneous ""skipping"" of one of the daily bouts was observed under several different conditions. Second, the presence of two bouts of activity/day, with different periods, was observed. Lastly, we were able to separately synchronize bouts of activity to two artificial tidal regimes with different periods.

One of the attractions of Limulus as a preparation for studies of vision is that it has three different types of eyes-a pair of later compound, image-forming eyes and two types of simple eyes, a pair of median ocelli, and three pair of larval eyes. Each eye type is tractable for experimentation. Limulus also has extraocular photoreceptors in its segmental ganglia and tail. The current contribution focuses on photoreceptors in Limulus larval eyes and ocelli and its extraocular photoreceptors with the goal of summarizing what is currently known and not known about their physiology and function and the opsins they express. The Limulus genome encodes a surprisingly large number of opsins (18), and studies of their expression pattern have raised new questions about the role of opsin co-expression, the functions of peropsins expressed outside of eyes, and the physiological relevance of opsins with apparently very low expression levels. Studies of opsin expression in Limulus lead one to wonder whether photoreceptors yet to be discovered might be present throughout its central nervous system.",10.1093/icb/icw093,

Homologous transcripts were discovered for one circadian clock input gene, five core genes, 22 accessory genes, and two possible output pathways. Alignments and functional domain analyses showed generally high conservation between the putative L. polyphemus clock genes and homologs from Drosophila melanogaster and Daphnia pulex. The presence of both cry1 and cry2 in the L. polyphemus transcriptome would classify its system as an ""ancestral"", type 2 clock system.

We monitored the year-round migratory patterns and residency of this species in a coastal embayment at Tsuyazaki, Japan, using acoustic telemetry. Total 20 adult crabs (15 males and 5 females) were tagged with ultrasonic transmitters and tracked during two periods (2006-2008; n = 10 and 2007-2009; n = 10). Adult crabs were more active during periods of higher water temperatures and their activity peaked in July, during the spawning period. Water temperature appeared to be one of the key factors influencing the movement patterns for the species. Moreover, the crabs tended to be more active at night than in the day. The nocturnal activity pattern was clearly evident before and during the reproductive period (May-August). Tracking data also showed that one pair-bond was maintained for a maximum of 17 days after the pair-bonded female had spawned. Overall, 11 males (73% of 15 individuals) remained in the bay area over winter, whereas three females (60% of 5 individuals) overwintered outside of the bay. Telemetry data showed that over 60% (13 of 20) of tagged crabs overwintered within the bay where there are sandy beaches, mudflats, and scattered seagrass beds. This year-round residence by adult T. tridentatus in the bay area identifies it as a critical habitat for the management of this species, regardless of life-stage. Not only is it a comprehensive management strategy that effectively reflects this species' habitat use patterns but also its implementation, such as the establishment of a protected area, would contribute to its conservation.",10.1371/journal.pone.0147429,

Limited genomic and transcriptional data are currently available to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the embryonic development of T. tridentatus. Here, we reported for the first time the de novo transcriptome assembly for T. tridentatus at embryonic developmental stage using Illumina RNA-seq platform. Approximate 38 million reads were obtained and further assembled into 133,212 unigenes. Sequence homology analysis against public databases revealed that 33,796 unigenes could be annotated with gene descriptions. Of the annotated unigenes, we identified a number of key components of several conserved metazoan signaling pathways (Hedgehog, Wnt, TGF-beta and Notch pathways) and other important regulatory genes involved in embryonic development. Targeted searching of Pax family genes which play critical roles in the formation of tissue and organ during embryonic development identified a complete set of Pax family genes. Moreover, the full length T. tridentatus Pax1/9a (TtPax1/9a) and Pax1/9b (TtPax1/9b) cDNA sequences were determined based on the transcriptome, demonstrating the immediate application of our database. Using quantitative real time PCR, we analyzed the expression patterns of TtPax1/9a and TtPax1/9b in different tissues of horseshoe crab. Taking advantage of Drosophila model, we further found that TtPax1/9b, but not TtPax1/9a, can partly rescue the Drosophila homolog Poxm dysfunction-caused lethality at the larval stage. Our study provides the embryonic transcriptome of T. tridentatus which could be immediately used for gene discovery and characterization, functional genomics studies in T. tridentatus.

In this study, we examined the sublethal effects of two metals, copper and cadmium, on horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) embryos. Exposure to copper or cadmium at concentrations of 0.01-10 mg/L for periods of 4, 8, 16 and 24 h had minimal effect on embryo survival except at 100 mg/L Cu. However, metal-exposed embryos took significantly longer to hatch into first instar (""trilobite"") larvae than seawater controls. Levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), believed to be important in the response to oxidative stress, were determined by Western blotting. Both the Cu/Zn and Mn cofactor forms of SOD tended to be somewhat elevated in metal-exposed embryos, but the increases were neither dose nor time-dependent. Likewise, SOD enzymatic activity showed no significant differences comparing embryos exposed to metals with seawater controls. We conclude that the protective role of SOD's against ROS produced in response to metal exposure appears to be limited in horseshoe crab embryos, at least under our experimental conditions.",10.1186/s40064-015-1267-1,
273,Responses of growth and hemolymph quality in juvenile Chinese horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus (Xiphosura) to sublethal tributyltin and cadmium.,"Billy K Y Kwan, Alice K Y Chan, Siu Gin Cheung, Paul K S Shin",2015,"Responses of growth endpoints and hemolymph constituents in juvenile Chinese horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus under treatments of 0.01 and 0.1 mg/l tributyltin (TBT) and 0.1 and 1 mg/l cadmium (Cd) were examined in a 12-week experiment. A significant decline in final body weight, final prosomal width, percentage of individuals molted and mean molting time was detected under TBT exposures. While morphological abnormalities of the juveniles between TBT treatments and the control were statistically indistinguishable, significantly higher occurrences of carapace erosion and appendage loss were noted under 0.1 and 1 mg/l Cd exposures. Various hemolymph quality indicators, including hemolymph plasma protein level, amebocyte viability and percentage of granular-spherical state of amebocytes of the juveniles exposed to TBT or Cd were significantly lower than the control. Such a decrease in hemolymph quality suggested deleterious effects of metal contaminant-induced stressors on the health status of the juveniles even at low exposure levels (i.e., 0.01 mg/l TBT and 0.1 mg/l Cd). Changes of hemolymph parameters in juvenile horseshoe crabs were more sensitive than growth performance as well as morphological abnormalities in response to metal stressors, and can be used as an indicator to reflect habitat conditions and contaminant levels.",10.1007/s10646-015-1524-7,
274,Effects of Perivitelline Fluid Obtained from Horseshoe Crab on The Proliferation and Genotoxicity of Dental Pulp Stem Cells.,"Marahaini Musa, Khadijah Mohd Ali, Thirumulu Ponnuraj Kannan, Ahmad Azlina, Nor Shamsuria Omar, Anil Chatterji, Khairani Idah Mokhtar",2015,"Perivitelline fluid (PVF) of the horseshoe crab embryo has been reported to possess an important role during embryogenesis by promoting cell proliferation. This study aims to evaluate the effect of PVF on the proliferation, chromosome aberration (CA) and mutagenicity of the dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). This is an in vitro experimental study. PVF samples were collected from horseshoe crabs from beaches in Malaysia and the crude extract was prepared. DPSCs were treated with different concentrations of PVF crude extract in an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (cytotoxicity test). We choose two inhibitory concentrations (IC50 and IC25) and two PVF concentrations which produced more cell viability compared to a negative control (100%) for further tests. Quantitative analysis of the proliferation activity of PVF was studied using the AlamarBlue®assay for 10 days. Population doubling times (PDTs) of the treatment groups were calculated from this assay. Genotoxicity was evaluated based on the CA and Ames tests. Statistical analysis was carried out using independent t test to calculate significant differences in the PDT and mitotic indices in the CA test between the treatment and negative control groups. Significant differences in the data were P<0.05. A total of four PVF concentrations retrieved from the MTT assay were 26.887 mg/ml (IC50), 14.093 mg/ml (IC25), 0.278 mg/ml (102% cell viability) and 0.019 mg/ml (102.5% cell viability). According to the AlamarBlue®assay, these PVF groups produced comparable proliferation activities compared to the negative (untreated) control. PDTs between PVF groups and the negative control were insignificantly different (P>0.05). No significant aberrations in chromosomes were observed in the PVF groups and the Ames test on the PVF showed the absence of significant positive results. PVF from horseshoe crabs produced insignificant proliferative activity on treated DPSCs. The PVF was non-genotoxic based on the CA and Ames tests.",10.22074/cellj.2016.3726,
275,Factor B Is the Second Lipopolysaccharide-binding Protease Zymogen in the Horseshoe Crab Coagulation Cascade.,"Yuki Kobayashi, Toshiaki Takahashi, Toshio Shibata, Shunsuke Ikeda, Takumi Koshiba, Hikaru Mizumura, Toshio Oda, Shun-ichiro Kawabata",2015,"Factor B is a serine-protease zymogen in the horseshoe crab coagulation cascade, and it is the primary substrate for activated factor C, the LPS-responsive initiator of the cascade. Factor C is autocatalytically activated to α-factor C on LPS and is artificially converted to β-factor C, another activated form, by chymotrypsin. It is not known, however, whether LPS is required for the activation of factor B. Here we found that wild-type factor B expressed in HEK293S cells is activated by α-factor C, but not by β-factor C, in an LPS-dependent manner and that β-factor C loses the LPS binding activity of factor C through additional cleavage by chymotrypsin within the N-terminal LPS-binding region. Surface plasmon resonance and quartz crystal microbalance analyses revealed that wild-type factor B binds to LPS with high affinity comparable with that of factor C, demonstrating that factor B is the second LPS-binding zymogen in the cascade. An LPS-binding site of wild-type factor B was found in the N-terminal clip domain, and the activation rate of a clip domain deletion mutant was considerably slower than that of wild-type factor B. Moreover, in the presence of LPS, Triton X-100 inhibited the activation of wild-type factor B by α-factor C. We conclude that the clip domain of factor B has an important role in localizing factor B to the surface of Gram-negative bacteria or LPS released from bacteria to initiate effective proteolytic activation by α-factor C.",10.1074/jbc.M115.653196,

Using a multiple-stressors approach, we examined whether the rate of embryonic development is affected by exposure to combinations of three factors: temperature (25, 30 and 35°C), salinity (5, 15 and 34 ppt) and ambient O2 (5%, 13% and 21% O2). Newly fertilized eggs were incubated under 27 fully factorial stressor combinations for 14 days, then allowed to recover in control conditions (30°C, 34 ppt, 21% O2) for an additional 14 days. Growth rate was measured every 2 days throughout the experiment (N=1289). We found that the effect of isolated stressors (high temperature, low salinity or low O2) reduced developmental success by up to 72% (low salinity), and that stressor combinations showed stronger effects and evidence of complex interactions. For example, low O2 had little effect individually but was lethal in combination with high temperature, and low temperature in isolation slightly decreased the rate of development but reduced the negative effects of low salinity and low O2. Development was delayed under exposure to low O2 but resumed upon return to control conditions after a 10 day lag. These data demonstrate that complex, synergistic interactions among abiotic stressors can substantially alter the development of a coastal invertebrate in ways that may not be predicted from the effects of the stressors in isolation.",10.1242/jeb.117184,

A plasma lectin isolated from the hemolymph of Taiwanese Tachypleus tridentatus recognizes bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), yet its structure and mechanism of action remain unclear, largely because of limited availability of horseshoe crabs and the lack of a heterogeneous expression system. In this study, we have successfully expressed and purified a soluble and functional recombinant horseshoe crab plasma lectin (rHPL) in an Escherichia coli system. Interestingly, rHPL bound not only to bacteria and LPSs like the native HPL but also to selective medically important pathogens isolated from clinical specimens, such as Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes. The binding was demonstrated to occur through a specific molecular interaction with rhamnose in pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the bacterial surface. Additionally, rHPL inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The results suggest that a specific protein-glycan interaction between rHPL and rhamnosyl residue may further facilitate development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for microbial pathogens.",10.1371/journal.pone.0115296,
278,The horseshoe crab of the genus Limulus: living fossil or stabilomorph?,"Adrian Kin, Błażej Błażejowski",2014,"A new horseshoe crab species, Limulus darwini, is described from the uppermost Jurassic (ca. 148 Ma) near-shore sediments of the Kcynia Formation, central Poland. The only extant species Limulus polyphemus (Linnaeus) inhabits brackish-marine, shallow water environments of the east coast of the United States. Here it is shown that there are no important morphological differences between the Kcynia Formation specimens and extant juvenile representatives of the genus Limulus. The palaeoecological setting inhabited by the new species and the trophic relationships of extant horseshoe crabs are discussed in an attempt to determine the potential range of food items ingested by these Mesozoic xiphosurans. In this paper we propose the adoption of a new term stabilomorphism, this being: an effect of a specific formula of adaptative strategy among organisms whose taxonomic status does not exceed genus-level. A high effectiveness of adaptation significantly reduces the need for differentiated phenotypic variants in response to environmental changes and provides for long-term evolutionary success.",10.1371/journal.pone.0108036,

We examined the concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, mercury, and selenium in the eggs of horseshoe crabs from Delaware Bay (between New Jersey and Delaware, USA) in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1999, 2000, and 2012 to determine if there were significant temporal changes and if levels appear to pose a health risk to the crabs themselves, or to predators that consume them. All metal levels declined in horseshoe crab eggs between 1994 and 2012, although the declines were much less consistent for lead and chromium than that for mercury and cadmium. Levels of contaminants found in these eggs are well below those known to cause adverse effects in the crabs themselves or to organisms that consume them, such as migrating shorebirds.",10.1007/s10661-014-3901-8,
280,Joint assembly and genetic mapping of the Atlantic horseshoe crab genome reveals ancient whole genome duplication.,"Carlos W Nossa, Paul Havlak, Jia-Xing Yue, Jie Lv, Kimberly Y Vincent, H Jane Brockmann, Nicholas H Putnam",2014,"Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods with a fossil record extending back approximately 450 million years. They exhibit remarkable morphological stability over their long evolutionary history, retaining a number of ancestral arthropod traits, and are often cited as examples of ""living fossils."" As arthropods, they belong to the Ecdysozoa, an ancient super-phylum whose sequenced genomes (including insects and nematodes) have thus far shown more divergence from the ancestral pattern of eumetazoan genome organization than cnidarians, deuterostomes and lophotrochozoans. However, much of ecdysozoan diversity remains unrepresented in comparative genomic analyses. Here we apply a new strategy of combined de novo assembly and genetic mapping to examine the chromosome-scale genome organization of the Atlantic horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. We constructed a genetic linkage map of this 2.7 Gbp genome by sequencing the nuclear DNA of 34 wild-collected, full-sibling embryos and their parents at a mean redundancy of 1.1x per sample. The map includes 84,307 sequence markers grouped into 1,876 distinct genetic intervals and 5,775 candidate conserved protein coding genes. Comparison with other metazoan genomes shows that the L. polyphemus genome preserves ancestral bilaterian linkage groups, and that a common ancestor of modern horseshoe crabs underwent one or more ancient whole genome duplications 300 million years ago, followed by extensive chromosome fusion. These results provide a counter-example to the often noted correlation between whole genome duplication and evolutionary radiations. The new, low-cost genetic mapping method for obtaining a chromosome-scale view of non-model organism genomes that we demonstrate here does not require laboratory culture, and is potentially applicable to a broad range of other species.",10.1186/2047-217X-3-9,

Maximum congregation size of the trilobite larvae was found in the white zone respectively where (n = 12) followed by yellow (n = 8) and orange (n = 8), which showed the larval preference for lighter zones. Morisita's index calculation showed a clumped/aggregated distribution (yellow, blue, orange and white) and uniform/hyper dispersed distribution (green, red and black) for various colours tested. Trilobite larvae showed least preference for brighter regions while tested in the experiment [black; (n = 4) and red; (n = 5)]. Experiments done to determine the light sensitivity of trilobite larvae showed that the larvae had more preference towards ultraviolet lights. The maximum congregation size of 38.8 and 40.7% of the larvae was encountered under ultraviolet light, when the light sources were kept horizontal and vertical, respectively. Overall, results suggested that the trilobite larvae of C. rotundicauda, preferred light source of shorter wavelengths (UV light) and colours of lighter zone (white, yellow, orange), which might be due to their adaptation to their natural habitat for predator avoidance, prey selection and water quality.",,

Declining abundance of spawning Limulus females in heavily harvested regions suggests deleterious effects of this activity, and while mortality rates of the harvest process are known to be 10%-30%, sublethal behavioral and physiological effects are not known. In this study, we determined the impact of the harvest process on locomotion and hemocyanin levels of 28 female horseshoe crabs. While mortality rates after bleeding (18%) were similar to previous studies, we found significant decreases in the linear and angular velocity of freely moving animals, as well as changes in their activity levels and expression of circatidal behavioral rhythms. Further, we found reductions in hemocyanin levels, which may alter immune function and cuticle integrity. These previously unrecognized behavioral and physiological deficits suggest that the harvest of LAL may decrease female fitness, and thus may contribute to the current population decline.",10.1086/BBLv225n3p137,

In order to gain better insight into the interaction between LPS and AMPs, we determined the structure of tachyplesin I (TP I), an antimicrobial peptide derived from horseshoe crab, in its bound state with LPS and proposed the complex structure of TP I and LPS using a docking program. CD and NMR measurements revealed that binding to LPS slightly extends the two β-strands of TP I and stabilizes the whole structure of TP I. The fluorescence wavelength of an intrinsic tryptophan of TP I and fluorescence quenching in the presence or absence of LPS indicated that a tryptophan residue is incorporated into the hydrophobic environment of LPS. Finally, we succeeded in proposing a structural model for the complex of TP I and LPS by using a docking program. The calculated model structure suggested that the cationic residues of TP I interact with phosphate groups and saccharides of LPS, whereas hydrophobic residues interact with the acyl chains of LPS.",10.1016/j.bbapap.2013.12.017,

Enhancement in number and diameter of blood vessels after treatment with PVF and lectin suggested their pro-angiogenic effect.

The body is divided into functional units or tagmata which are usually distinguished by further differentiation of the limbs. The living horseshoe crabs are remnants of a much larger diversity of aquatic chelicerates. The limbs of the anterior and posterior divisions of the body of living horseshoe crabs differ in the loss of the outer and inner ramus, respectively, of an ancestral biramous limb. Here we report a new fossil horseshoe crab from the mid-Silurian Lagerstätte in Herefordshire, United Kingdom (approximately 425 Myr B.P.), a site that has yielded a remarkably preserved assemblage of soft-bodied fossils. The limbs of the new form can be homologized with those of living Limulus, but retain an ancestral biramous morphology. Remarkably, however, the two limb branches originate separately, providing fossil evidence to suggest that repression or loss of gene expression might have given rise to the appendage morphology of Limulus. Both branches of the prosomal limbs of this new fossil are robust and segmented in contrast to their morphology in Cambrian arthropods, revealing that a true biramous limb was once present in chelicerates as well as in the mandibulates.",10.1073/pnas.1205875109,

This location was identified as spawning site due to the occurrence of horseshoe crab spawning pairs and nests. Size-frequency, length-weight relationships, sex ratio and epibiont infestation of Tachypleus gigas were studied. Instar stage was estimated based on prosomal width. Condition of the horseshoe crab carapace was reported. Visual search technique of horseshoe crab was conducted during high tide of new and full moons. Prosomal, opisthosomal and telson length and weight of each horseshoe crab were measured. Largest female was recorded with mean prosomal length and width of 154.4 and 246.9 mm, respectively. About 69.8% of the males belonged to size group of 151-200 mm and 53.3% of females were grouped into 201-250 mm. All individuals were of fourteenth to sixteenth instar stages. Sex ratio varied from 0.313 to 2.5 and attributed to commercial harvest and monsoon season. Sand sediment of study site showed 93% of fine sands with grain size ranged from 120 to 250 microm. Acorn and pedunculate barnacle, conical and flat slipper shells were found on the carapace of the specimens. Most males had damaged eyes and carapaces while females with broken telsons. Body damages of about 19.9% on the specimens were likely due to nearby fishing activities. Lack of satellite male indicated low spawning population.

To understand the molecular mechanism of C3b deposition on microbes, we characterized two types of C2/factor B homologs (designated TtC2/Bf-1 and TtC2/Bf-2) identified from the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus. Although the domain architectures of TtC2/Bf-1 and TtC2/Bf-2 were identical to those of mammalian homologs, they contained five-repeated and seven-repeated complement control protein domains at their N-terminal regions, respectively. TtC2/Bf-1 and TtC2/Bf-2 were synthesized and glycosylated in hemocytes and secreted to hemolymph plasma, which existed in a complex with C3 (TtC3), and their activation by microbes was absolutely Mg(2+)-dependent. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that TtC3b deposition was Mg(2+)-dependent on Gram-positive bacteria or fungi, but not on Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, this analysis demonstrated that Ca(2+)-dependent lectins (C-reactive protein-1 and tachylectin-5A) were required for TtC3b deposition on Gram-positive bacteria, and that a Ca(2+)-independent lectin (Tachypleus plasma lectin-1) was definitely indispensable for TtC3b deposition on fungi. In contrast, a horseshoe crab lipopolysaccharide-sensitive protease factor C was necessary and sufficient to deposit TtC3b on Gram-negative bacteria. We conclude that plasma lectins and factor C play key roles in microbe-specific TtC3b deposition in a C2/factor B-dependent or -independent manner.",10.1371/journal.pone.0036783,
289,"Ultrastructure of book gill development in embryos and first instars of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus L. (Chelicerata, Xiphosura).",Roger D Farley,2012,"The transmission electron microscope (TEM) is used for the first time to study the development of book gills in the horseshoe crab. Near the end of the nineteenth century the hypothesis was presented for homology and a common ancestry for horseshoe crab book gills and arachnid book lungs. The present developmental study and the author's recent ones of book gills (SEM) and scorpion book lungs (TEM) are intended to clarify early histological work and provide new ultrastructural details for further research and for hypotheses about evolutionary history and relationships. The observations herein are in agreement with earlier reports that the book gill lamellae are formed by proliferation and evagination of epithelial cells posterior to opisthosomal branchial appendages. A cartilage-like endoskeleton is produced in the base of the opisthosomal appendages. The lamellar precursor cells in the appendage base proliferate, migrate outward and secrete the lamellar cuticle from their apical surface. A series of external, posteriorly-directed lamellae is formed, with each lamella having a central channel for hemolymph and pillar-type space holders formed from cells of the opposed walls. This repeated, page-like pattern results also in water channels (without space holders) between the sac-like hemolymph lamellae. The developmental observations herein and in an earlier study (TEM) of scorpion book lungs show that the lamellae in book gills and book lungs result from some similar activities and features of the precursor epithelial cells: proliferation, migration, alignment and apical/basal polarity with secretion of cuticle from the apical surface and the basal surface in contact with hemolymph. These cellular similarities and the resulting book-like structure suggest a common ancestry, but there are also substantial developmental differences in producing these organs for gas exchange in the different environments, aqueous and terrestrial. For scorpion book lungs, the invaginated precursor cells align in rows and secrete rows of cell fragments that are the basis for the internal, anterior-directed air sacs. The hemolymph sacs of book gills are formed by epithelial evagination or outfolding from the posterior surface of the branchial appendages.",10.1186/1742-9994-9-4,

In the innate immune system of invertebrates, multi-domain protease inhibitors are important for the regulation of host-pathogen interactions and antimicrobial activities. Serine protease inhibitors, 9.3-kDa CrSPI isoforms 1 and 2, have been identified from the hepatopancreas of the horseshoe crab, Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda. The CrSPIs were biochemically active, especially CrSPI-1, which potently inhibited subtilisin (Ki = 1.43 nM). CrSPI has been grouped with the non-classical Kazal-type inhibitors due to its unusual cysteine distribution. Here we report the crystal structure of CrSPI-1 in complex with subtilisin at 2.6 Å resolution and the results of biophysical interaction studies. The CrSPI-1 molecule has two domains arranged in an extended conformation. These two domains act as heads that independently interact with two separate subtilisin molecules, resulting in the inhibition of subtilisin activity at a ratio of 1:2 (inhibitor to protease). Each subtilisin molecule interacts with the reactive site loop from each domain of CrSPI-1 through a standard canonical binding mode and forms a single ternary complex. In addition, we propose the substrate preferences of each domain of CrSPI-1. Domain 2 is specific towards the bacterial protease subtilisin, while domain 1 is likely to interact with the host protease, Furin. Elucidation of the structure of the CrSPI-1: subtilisin (1∶2) ternary complex increases our understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the innate immune system at the molecular level and provides new strategies for immunomodulation.",10.1371/journal.pone.0018838,

The simplicity, specificity and rapidity of its antimicrobial response have accorded the horseshoe crab as an excellent animal model from which immune responsive tissues may be procured for biomedical research. Such usefulness is exemplified by the extensive application for nearly four decades, of the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) for sensitive detection of endotoxin in the medical industry. Apart from the amebocytes, the cell-free hemolymph (CFH) of this arthropod offers a large repertoire of evolutionarily conserved proteins, which are highly sensitive to pathogens. This makes the hemolymph an ideal physiological microenvironment for simulating an in vitro infection. We therefore propose to employ the CFH as a quick and convenient tool for antimicrobial drug screening in vitro. This specific drug screening system also provides further optimization of drug design, and selection of drugs with antioxidant properties. Being an easily accessible natural resource, and allowing high-throughput screening with uniform and reliable data output, the horseshoe crab CFH provides a desirable physiological milieu for drug screening and development.",10.2174/138161211795703717,

Baseline vascular pH, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, base excess, total carbon dioxide, and lactate concentrations were determined from hemolymph samples collected from 10 horseshoe crabs (group 1) submerged in water and were compared with values after removal from water for 5 min, and after recovery in water for 10 min and for longer than 60 min (range, 61-221 min). Hemolymph gas parameters were also determined in 12 horseshoe crabs (group 2) after shipment out of water for 24 hr and were compared with values obtained from group 1 animals. Baseline hemolymph gas values of the American horseshoe crab are within range for other aquatic vertebrates. After removal from water for 5 min, all group 1 crabs developed severe hypoxia, with PO2 levels falling below the detectable limit of the analyzer. Group 2 crabs had pronounced respiratory acidosis, and their PO2 values were significantly below baseline values of group 1 animals.",10.1638/2008-0175R2.1,
296,"Book gill development in embryos and first and second instars of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus L. (Chelicerata, Xiphosura).",Roger D Farley,2010,"The scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to study the development of the opisthosomal appendages and book gills of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. Later embryonic stages were examined as well as the first and second instars. The observations are compared with a much earlier light microscopic description of book gill development in the horseshoe crab and with book lung development in scorpion embryos and first and second instars in a recent study with SEM. After the third embryonic molt in the horseshoe crab, the opisthosomal appendages are of sufficient size so they could be fractured or dissected open so internal cells and other structures could be examined. The opisthosomal appendages and book gill lamellae of first and second instars were also opened. The observations support the earlier histological report that the gill lamellae are a hypodermal outgrowth from the posterior surface of the preceding branchial appendages. The genital operculum, branchial appendages and gill lamellae are very thin and consist of external cuticle, hypodermis and space holders. The latter help hold the cuticle walls in place so hemolymph can flow through the narrow channels. The space holders are formed from cell processes that extend into the lumen from the hypodermis just inside the external cuticle. In the recent SEM study in scorpion embryos and in some histological investigations in spider embryos, the book lung lamellae are formed by alignment of cells from an invaginated sac or mass of cells. This clearly differs from the mode of formation of gill lamellae as observed in this and earlier investigations. These reports of differences in embryology refine but do not preclude hypotheses about book gill/book lung homology since addition, deletion or modification of ancestral features often occur for the benefit of the embryos and larvae.",10.1016/j.asd.2010.04.001,
297,"Factor G utilizes a carbohydrate-binding cleft that is conserved between horseshoe crab and bacteria for the recognition of beta-1,3-D-glucans.","Yuki Ueda, Shuhei Ohwada, Yoshito Abe, Toshio Shibata, Manabu Iijima, Yukiko Yoshimitsu, Takumi Koshiba, Munehiro Nakata, Tadashi Ueda, Shun-ichiro Kawabata",2009,"In the horseshoe crab, the recognition of beta-1,3-D-glucans by factor G triggers hemolymph coagulation. Factor G contains a domain of two tandem xylanase Z-like modules (Z1-Z2), each of which recognizes beta-1,3-D-glucans. To gain an insight into the recognition of beta-1,3-D-glucans from a structural view point, recombinants of Z1-Z2, the C-terminal module Z2, Z2 with a Cys to Ala substitution (Z2A), and its tandem repeat Z2A-Z2A were characterized. Z2 and Z1-Z2, but not Z2A and Z2A-Z2A, formed insoluble aggregates at higher concentrations more than approximately 30 and 3 microM, respectively. Z1-Z2 and Z2A-Z2A bound more strongly to an insoluble beta-1,3-D-glucan (curdlan) than Z2A. The affinity of Z2A for a soluble beta-1,3-D-glucan (laminarin) was equivalent to those of Z1-Z2, Z2A-Z2A, and native factor G, suggesting that the binding of a single xylanase Z-like module prevents the subsequent binding of another module to laminarin. Interestingly, Z2A as well as intact factor G exhibited fungal agglutinating activity, and fungi were specifically detected with fluorescently tagged Z2A by microscopy. The chemical shift perturbation of Z2A induced by the interaction with laminaripentaose was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The ligand-binding site of Z2A was located in a cleft on a beta-sheet in a predicted beta-sandwich structure, which was superimposed onto cleft B in a cellulose-binding module of endoglucanase 5A from the soil bacterium Cellvibrio mixtus. We conclude that the pattern recognition for beta-1,3-D-glucans by factor G is accomplished via a carbohydrate-binding cleft that is evolutionally conserved between horseshoe crab and bacteria.",10.4049/jimmunol.0900430,
298,"Using the horseshoe crab, Limulus Polyphemus, in vision research.","Jiahui S Liu, Christopher L Passaglia",2009,"The American horseshoe crab, Limulus Polyphemus is one of the oldest creatures on earth, and the animal continues to play an indispensable role in biomedical research. Not only does their blood contain special cells that scientists use to detect bacteriotoxins in our medicines, but their eyes also contain a neural network that has provided much insight about physiological processes operating in our visual system, such as light adaptation and lateral inhibition. The horseshoe crab remains an attractive model for vision research because the animal is large and hardy for an invertebrate, its retinal neurons are big and easily accessible, its visual system is compact and extensively studied, and its visual behavior is well defined. Moreover, the structure and function of the eyes are modulated on a daily basis by a circadian clock in the animal s brain. In short, the visual system of horseshoe crabs is simple enough to be understood yet complex enough to be interesting. In this video we present three electrophysiological paradigms for investigating the neural basis of vision that can be performed in vivo with Limulus. They are electroretinogram recording, optic nerve recording, and intraretinal recording. Electroretinogram (ERG) recordings measure with a surface electrode the summed electrical response of all cells in the eye to a flash of light. They can be used to monitor the overall sensitivity of the eye for prolong periods of time. Optic nerve recordings measure the spiking activity of single nerve fibers with an extracellular microsuction electrode. They can be used to study visual messages conveyed from the eye to the brain as well as circadian-clock messages fed back from the brain to the eye. Intraretinal recordings measure with an intracellular microelectrode the voltage fluctuations induced by light in individual cells of the eye. They can be used to elucidate cellular mechanisms of retinal processing.",10.3791/1384,
299,"Blood collection from the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus.","Peter Armstrong, Mara Conrad",2008,"The horseshoe crab has the best-characterized immune system of any long-lived invertebrate. The study of immunity in horseshoe crabs has been facilitated by the ease in collecting large volumes of blood and from the simplicity of the blood. Horseshoe crabs show only a single cell type in the general circulation, the granular amebocyte. The plasma has the salt content of sea water and only three abundant proteins, hemocyanin, the respiratory protein, the C-reactive proteins, which function in the cytolytic destruction of foreign cells, including bacterial cells, and alpha2-macroglobulin, which inhibits the proteases of invading pathogens. Blood is collected by direct cardiac puncture under conditions that minimize contamination by lipopolysaccharide (a.k.a., endotoxin, LPS), a product of the Gram-negative bacteria. A large animal can yield 200 - 400 mL of blood. For the study of the plasma, blood cells are immediately removed from the plasma by centrifugation and the plasma can then be fractionated into its constituent proteins. The blood cells are conveniently studied microscopically by collecting small volumes of blood into LPS-free isotonic saline (0.5 M NaCl) under conditions that permit direct microscopic examination by placing one of more LPS-free coverglasses on the culture dish surface, then mounting those coverglasses in simple observation chambers following cell attachment. A second preparation for direct observation is to collect 3 - 5 mL of blood in a LPS-free embryo dish and then explanting fragments of aggregated amebocytes to a chamber that sandwiches the tissue between a slide and a coverglass. In this preparation, the motile amebocytes migrate onto the coverglass surface, where they can readily be observed. The blood clotting system involves aggregation of amebocytes and the formation of an extracellular clot of a protein, coagulin, which is released from the secretory granules of the blood cells. Biochemical analysis of washed blood cells requires that aggregation and degranulation does not occur, which can be accomplished by collecting blood into 0.1 volumes of 2% Tween-20, 0.5 M LPS-free NaCl, followed by centrifugation of the cells and washing with 0.5 M NaCl.",10.3791/958,
300,Factor C acts as a lipopolysaccharide-responsive C3 convertase in horseshoe crab complement activation.,"Shigeru Ariki, Shusaku Takahara, Toshio Shibata, Takaaki Fukuoka, Aya Ozaki, Yuichi Endo, Teizo Fujita, Takumi Koshiba, Shun-ichiro Kawabata",2008,"The complement system in vertebrates plays an important role in host defense against and clearance of invading microbes, in which complement component C3 plays an essential role in the opsonization of pathogens, whereas the molecular mechanism underlying C3 activation in invertebrates remains unknown. In an effort to understand the molecular activation mechanism of invertebrate C3, we isolated and characterized an ortholog of C3 (designated TtC3) from the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus. Flow cytometric analysis using an Ab against TtC3 revealed that the horseshoe crab complement system opsonizes both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Evaluation of the ability of various pathogen-associated molecular patterns to promote the proteolytic conversion of TtC3 to TtC3b in hemocyanin-depleted plasma indicated that LPS, but not zymosan, peptidoglycan, or laminarin, strongly induces this conversion, highlighting the selective response of the complement system to LPS stimulation. Although originally characterized as an LPS-sensitive initiator of hemolymph coagulation stored within hemocytes, we identified factor C in hemolymph plasma. An anti-factor C Ab inhibited various LPS-induced phenomena, including plasma amidase activity, the proteolytic activation of TtC3, and the deposition of TtC3b on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, activated factor C present on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria directly catalyzed the proteolytic conversion of the purified TtC3, thereby promoting TtC3b deposition. We conclude that factor C acts as an LPS-responsive C3 convertase on the surface of invading Gram-negative bacteria in the initial phase of horseshoe crab complement activation.",10.4049/jimmunol.181.11.7994,
301,News from an ancient world: two novel astacin metalloproteases from the horseshoe crab.,"Christoph Becker-Pauly, Bernd Cem Bruns, Olga Damm, André Schütte, Kada Hammouti, Thorsten Burmester, Walter Stöcker",2009,"In this work, we report the cloning, heterologous expression, and characterization of two novel astacin proteases from the chelicerate Limulus polyphemus (horseshoe crab), designated as LAST (Limulus astacin) and LAST_MAM (Limulus astacin containing a MAM domain), respectively. The expression pattern showed ubiquitous occurrence of LAST_MAM, while LAST was predominantly restricted to the eyes and brain, indicating a function in the nervous system. Both enzymes contain the characteristic metzincin-type zinc-binding region and Met turn. While LAST is made up only of the typical prodomain and astacin-like protease domain, LAST_MAM contains an additional MAM (meprin A5 protein tyrosine phosphatase micro) domain, which so far only has been found in few astacins such as the vertebrate meprin Hydra and squid enzymes, and in a number of other extracellular proteins such as A5 protein and tyrosine phosphatase micro. These gave rise to the designation MAM for this protein module. MAM domains have been shown to be responsible for protein oligomerization in meprin proteases and tyrosine phosphatase micro. Since the horseshoe crab has kept its body plan for almost half a billion years, it is therefore a privileged organism for the study of protease evolution. In this context, we could show by phylogenetic analysis that this protease is not related to the other MAM-domain-containing astacins indicating different evolutionary origins of these proteins. Moreover, we clearly demonstrated the divergent evolvement of the MAM module itself, and not only with regard to proteases. However, there are some unique functional features that are not shared by other members of this protein family. For example, LAST_MAM is the only astacin protease known so far that is active in its zymogen form, indicating that the presence of the N-terminal propeptide does not prevent proteolytic activity.",10.1016/j.jmb.2008.10.062,

A wide variety of molecules take part in various steps in this process. While exploring biologically active molecules from marine sources, we found that a constituent of perivitelline fluid from embryos of the Indian horseshoe crab can enhance growth and differentiation of chick embryonic heart. We have purified the factor and identified the cardiac promoting molecule to be a novel lectin. We show that this molecule influences cardiac development by increasing the number of cells constituting the heart and by modulating the expression of several cardiac development regulatory genes in chick embryos. Using mouse embryonic stem cells we show that the cardiac myocyte-enhancing capacity of this molecule extends to mammals and its effects can be blocked using methylated sugars. This molecule may prove to be an important tool in the study of cardiomyocyte differentiation.",10.1007/s00018-008-8246-4,

Relationship to circadian rhythms of visual sensitivity.","Winsor H Watson, Lisa Bedford, Christopher C Chabot",2008,"In the laboratory, horseshoe crabs express a circadian rhythm of visual sensitivity as well as daily and circatidal rhythms of locomotion. The major goal of this investigation was to determine whether the circadian clock underlying changes in visual sensitivity also modulates locomotion. To address this question, we developed a method for simultaneously recording changes in visual sensitivity and locomotion. Although every animal (24) expressed consistent circadian rhythms of visual sensitivity, rhythms of locomotion were more variable: 44% expressed a tidal rhythm, 28% were most active at night, and the rest lacked statistically significant rhythms. When exposed to artificial tides, 8 of 16 animals expressed circatidal rhythms of locomotion that continued after tidal cycles were stopped. However, rhythms of visual sensitivity remained stable and showed no tendency to be influenced by the imposed tides or locomotor activity. These results indicate that horseshoe crabs possess at least two biological clocks: one circadian clock primarily used for modulating visual sensitivity, and one or more clocks that control patterns of locomotion. This arrangement allows horseshoe crabs to see quite well while mating during both daytime and nighttime high tides.",10.2307/25470682,

In this study, we examined the ability of artificial tides to entrain the locomotor rhythms of Limulus in the laboratory. In experiments one and two, the activity of 16 individuals of L. polyphemus was monitored with activity boxes and ""running wheels."" When the crabs were exposed to artificial tides created by changes in water depth, circatidal rhythms were observed in animals exposed to 12.4-h ""tidal"" cycles of either water depth changes (8 of 8 animals) or inundation (7 of 8 animals). In experiment three, an additional 8 animals were exposed to water depth changes under cyclic conditions of light and dark and then monitored for 10 days with no imposed artificial tides. Most animals (5) clearly synchronized their activity to the imposed artificial tidal cycles, and 3 of these animals showed clear evidence of entrainment after the artificial tides were terminated. Overall, these results demonstrate that the endogenous tidal clock that influences locomotion in Limulus can be entrained by imposed artificial tides. In the laboratory, these tidal cues override the influence of light/dark cycles. In their natural habitat, where both tidal and photoperiod inputs are typically always present, their activity rhythms are likely to be much more complex.",10.2307/25470681,

Limulus eye development is of particular interest because these animals hold a unique position in arthropod phylogeny and possess multiple eye types. Furthermore, the molecular underpinnings of eye development have yet to be investigated in chelicerates.

DNA sequence analysis of 369 base pairs (bp) of the mt AT-rich region revealed 10 haplotypes among the 47 individuals, with a mean haplotypic diversity (h) of 0.626+/-0.075 and nucleotide diversity (pi) of 0.0039+/-0.00055. Pairwise F-statistics (F(ST)) revealed significantly high gene flow between Kinmen and Dongwei (F(ST)=-0.0351, p>0.05, N(e)m=infinity), but marked population subdivision and restricted gene flow between Kinmen and Tiexianwei (F(ST)=0.1382, p<0.05, N(e)m=3.1176).

Mismatch distribution analysis indicated that the relatively low haplotype and nucleotide diversity observed in the Tiexianwei T. tridentatus population can be attributed to a recent bottleneck, probably due to isolation of Tiexianwei in semi-closed Magong Bay that prevents gene flow from neighboring populations.",10.2108/zsj.24.219,
312,Shorebird predation of horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware Bay: species contrasts and availability constraints.,"S Gillings, P W Atkinson, S L Bardsley, N A Clark, S E Love, R A Robinson, R A Stillman, R G Weber",2007,"1. Functional responses -- the relationship between resource intake rate and resource abundance -- are widely used in explaining predator-prey interactions yet many studies indicate that resource availability is crucial in dictating intake rates. 2. For time-stressed migrant birds refuelling at passage sites, correct decisions concerning patch use are crucial as they determine fattening rates and an individual's future survival and reproduction. Measuring availability alongside abundance is essential if spatial and temporal patterns of foraging are to be explained. 3. A suite of shorebird species stage in Delaware Bay where they consume horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus eggs. Several factors including spawning activity and weather give rise to marked spatial and temporal variation in the abundance and availability of eggs. We undertook field experiments to determine and contrast the intake rates of shorebird species pecking for surface and probing for buried eggs. 4. Whether eggs were presented on the sand surface or buried, we demonstrate strong aggregative responses and rapid depletion (up to 80%). Depletion was greater at deeper depths when more eggs were present. No consistent give-up densities were found. Type II functional responses were found for surface eggs and buried eggs, with peck success twice as high in the former. Maximum intake rates of surface eggs were up to 83% higher than those of buried eggs. 5. Caution is needed when applying functional responses predicted on the basis of morphology. Our expectation of a positive relationship between body size and intake rate was not fully supported. The smallest species, semipalmated sandpiper, had the lowest intake rate but the largest species, red knot, achieved only the same intake rate as the mid-sized dunlin. 6. These functional responses indicate that probing is rarely more profitable than pecking. Currently, few beaches provide egg densities sufficient for efficient probing. Areas where eggs are deposited on the sand surface are critical for successful foraging and ongoing migration. This may be especially true for red knot, which have higher energetic demands owing to their larger body size yet appear to have depressed intake rates because they consume smaller prey than their body size should permit.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2007.01229.x,

Thus, we explored the development of the lateral eyes and associated neuropils in late embryos and larvae of these animals. The first external evidence of the lateral eyes was the appearance of white pigment spots-guanophores associated with the rudimentary photoreceptors-on the dorsolateral side of the late embryos, suggesting that these embryos can perceive light. The first brown pigment emerges in the eyes during the last (third) embryonic molt to the trilobite stage. However, ommatidia develop from this field of pigment toward the end of the larval trilobite stage so that the young larvae at hatching do not have object recognition. Double staining with the proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and an antibody against L. polyphemus myosin III, which is concentrated in photoreceptors of this species, confirmed previous reports that, in the trilobite larvae, new cellular material is added to the eye field from an anteriorly located proliferation zone. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that these new cells differentiate into new ommatidia. Examining larval eyes labeled for opsin showed that the new ommatidia become organized into irregular rows that give the eye field a triangular appearance. Within the eye field, the ommatidia are arranged in an imperfect hexagonal array. Myosin III immunoreactivity in trilobite larvae also revealed the architecture of the central visual pathways associated with the median eye complex and the lateral eyes. Double labeling with myosin III and BrdU showed that neurogenesis persists in the larval brain and suggested that new neurons of both the lamina and the medulla originate from a single common proliferation zone. These data are compared with eye development in Drosophila melanogaster and are discussed with regard to new ideas on eye evolution in the Euarthropoda.",10.1002/dvdy.20866,
317,"Response of the blood clotting system of the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, to a novel form of lipopolysaccharide from a green alga.","Mara L Conrad, R L Pardy, Norman Wainwright, Alice Child, Peter B Armstrong",2006,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) is a component of Gram-negative bacteria and is the principal indicator to the innate immune systems of higher animals of a Gram-negative bacterial invasion. LPS activates the blood clotting system of the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. By stimulating blood cell degranulation, LPS triggers the release of the proteins of the clotting system from the cells, and by activating a protease cascade that converts coagulogen, a soluble zymogen, to coagulin, the structural protein of the clot, LPS triggers the production of the fibrillar coagulin blood clot. Although originally thought to be restricted to the Gram-negative bacteria and the cyanobacteria, LPS, or a very similar molecule, has recently been described from a eukaryotic green alga, Chlorella. Here we show that, like LPS from Gram-negative bacteria, the algal molecule stimulates exocytosis of the Limulus blood cell and the clotting of coagulin. The coagulin clot efficiently entraps the cells of Chlorella in a network of fibrils. Invasion and erosion of the carapace by green algae is an important cause of mortality of Limulus, and it is suggested that the cellular response to aLPS may contribute to defense against this pathogen.",10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.03.013,
318,Recognition of pathogens and activation of immune responses in Drosophila and horseshoe crab innate immunity.,"Shoichiro Kurata, Shigeru Ariki, Shun-ichiro Kawabata",2006,"In innate immunity, pattern recognition receptors discriminate between self- and infectious non-self-matter. Mammalian homologs of the Drosophila Toll protein, which are collectively referred to as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and lipoproteins, whereas the Drosophila Toll protein does not act as a PAMP receptor, but rather binds to Spätzle, an endogenous peptide. In Drosophila, innate immune surveillance is mediated by members of the peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) family, which recognize diverse bacteria-derived peptidoglycans and initiate appropriate immune reactions including the release of antimicrobial peptides and the activation of the prophenoloxidase cascade, the latter effecting localized wound healing, melanization, and microbial phagocytosis. In the horseshoe crab, LPS induces hemocyte exocytotic degranulation, resulting in the secretion of various defense molecules, such as coagulation factors, antimicrobial peptides, and lectins. Recent studies have demonstrated that the zymogen form of the serine protease factor C, a major granular component of hemocyte, also exists on the hemocyte surface and functions as a biosensor for LPS. The proteolytic activity of activated factor C initiates hemocyte exocytosis via a G protein mediated signal transduction pathway. Furthermore, it has become clear that an endogenous mechanism for the feedback amplification of the innate immune response exists and is dependent upon a granular component of the horseshoe crab hemocyte.",10.1016/j.imbio.2005.10.016,

We extensively determined the sequences of horseshoe crab cuticular proteins. Proteins extracted from a part of the ventral side of the cuticle were purified by chitin-affinity chromatography, and separated by two-dimensional SDS/PAGE. Proteins appearing on the gel were designated high molecular mass chitin-binding proteins, and these proteins were then grouped into classes based on their approximate isoelectric points and predominant amino acid compositions. Members of groups designated basic G, basic Y, and acidic S groups contained a so-called Rebers and Riddiford consensus found in arthropod cuticular proteins. Proteins designated acidic DE25 and DE29 each contained a Cys-rich domain with sequences similar to those of insect peritrophic matrix proteins and chitinases. In contrast, basic QH4 and QH10 contained no consensus sequences found in known chitin-binding proteins. Alternatively, a low molecular mass chitin-binding fraction was prepared by size exclusion chromatography, and 15 low molecular mass chitin-binding proteins, named P1 through P15, were isolated. With the exception of P9 and P15, all were found to be identical to known antimicrobial peptides. P9 consisted of a Kunitz-type chymotrypsin inhibitor sequence, and P15 contained a Cys-rich motif found in insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins. Interestingly, we observed transglutaminase-dependent polymerization of nearly all high molecular mass chitin-binding proteins, a finding suggests that transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking plays an important role in host defense in the arthropod cuticle, analogous to that observed in the epidermal cornified cell envelope in mammals.",10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04891.x,

Here, we report the co-regulation of diverse clusters of functionally related immune response genes in a horseshoe crab, Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda. Expressed sequence tag (EST) clusters for frontline immune defense, cell signalling, apoptosis and stress response genes were expressed or repressed spatio-temporally during the acute phase of Pseudomonas infection. An infection time course monitored by virtual Northern evaluation indicates upregulation of genes in blood cells (amebocytes) at 3-h postinfection, whereas most of the hepatopancreas genes remained down regulated over 72 h of infection. Thus, the two tissues orchestrate a coordinated and timely response to infection. The hepatopancreas probably immuno-modulates the expression of other genes and serves as a reservoir for later response, if/when chronic infection ensues. On the other hand, being the first to encounter pathogens, we reasoned that amebocytes would respond acutely to infection. Besides acute transactivation of the immune genes, the amebocytes maintained morphological integrity, indicating their ability to synthesise and store/secrete the immune proteins and effectors to sustain the frontline innate immune defense, while simultaneously elicit complement-mediated phagocytosis of the invading pathogen. Our results show that the immune response against Pseudomonas infection is spatially and temporally coordinated.",10.1038/sj.gene.6364240,

The yield of adsorption of azinphosmethyl from aqueous solution ranged from 56.1% to 61% with temperature increasing. Kinetic studies showed that adsorption rate decreased as the initial azinphosmethyl concentration increased. It was found, that the adsorption reaction obeyed first-order kinetics. The overall rate constants were estimated for different temperatures. The activation energy for adsorption was about 1.52 kJmol(-1), which implies that azinphosmethyl mainly adsorbed physically onto Horseshoe Crab outer shell. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were applied to the experimental data and isotherm constants were calculated. The thermodynamic parameters DeltaG0, DeltaH0 and DeltaS0 for the adsorption reaction were evaluated based on equilibrium data and in connection with this result the thermodynamic aspects of adsorption reaction were discussed. The adsorption was found to be endothermic in nature. The adsorbent used in this study proved highly efficient for the removal of azinphosmethyl.",10.1016/j.biortech.2004.09.023,

The role of TRP channels in other invertebrate photoreceptors is unknown, particularly those, exemplified by Limulus ventral eye photoreceptors, in which calcium release from intracellular stores is prominent. We have amplified cDNA encoding three variants of a Limulus TRP channel. LptrpA and LptrpBencode proteins of 896 and 923 amino acids, differing by a 27 amino acid insert within the C-terminus. LptrpC encodes an alternative 63 amino acid sequence in the pore domain compared with LptrpB. LptrpB and LptrpC are present in ventral eye mRNA, while LptrpA is only present in brain mRNA. In situ hybridization indicates the presence of Lptrp in photoreceptors of the Limulus ventral eye. Some canonical TRP channels can be activated by diacylglycerol analogs. Injection of a diacylglycerol analog, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), into Limulus photoreceptors can activate an inward current with electrical characteristics similar to the light-activated current. However, simultaneous elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration appears to be necessary. Illumination attenuates the response to OAG injections and vice versa.

Previous studies have shown there is an endogenous rhythm in retinal structure and this rhythm is enhanced by light. The purpose of this study was to determine whether changes in natural lighting influence these rhythms independent of season. To test this concept, horseshoe crabs were maintained in an aquarium tank and exposed to natural lighting only. The angle of the sun and foliage outside the room where the horseshoe crabs were maintained were such that more natural lighting reached the aquarium tank during winter days than summer days despite the fact that sunlight is more intense in the summer. Horseshoe crabs were sacrificed 2 hours, 5 hours, and 8 hours following local sunrise on a winter day (January 11th) and a summer day (June 19th), respectively, and the dimensions of several retinal parameters were quantified. Preliminary data indicate that certain structural rhythms were significantly more pronounced on the winter day when natural lighting was more intense. For example, 8 hours following sunrise, apertures were 4.2 times as long and 3.2 times more narrow on the winter day than on the summer day. These data suggest that the intensity of natural lighting is more important for regulating structural rhythms in the lateral eye than an endogenous seasonal clock.",,

Although adult crabs generally inhabit subtidal regions of estuaries with salinities from 5 to 34 ppt, developing embryos and larvae within nests are often exposed to more extreme conditions of salinity and temperature during summer spawning periods. To test whether these conditions have a negative impact on early development and survival, we determined development time, survival, and molt cycle duration for L. polyphemus embryos and larvae raised at 20 combinations of salinity (range: 30-60 ppt) and temperature (range: 25-40 degrees C). Additionally, the effect of hyperosmotic and hypoosmotic shock on the osmolarity of the perivitelline fluid of embryos was determined at salinities between 5 and 90 ppt. The embryos completed their development and molted at salinities below 60 ppt, yet failed to develop at temperatures of 35 degrees C or higher. Larval survival was high at salinities of 10-70 ppt but declined significantly at more extreme salinities (i.e., 5, 80, and 90 ppt). Perivitelline fluid remained nearly isoosmotic over the range of salinities tested. Results indicate that temperature and salinity influence the rate of crab development, but only the extremes of these conditions have an effect on survival.",10.2307/1543539,

Semaphorins are divided into eight classes according to species of origin and structural similarities. Classes 1 and 2 are found in invertebrates, classes 3 through 7 are present in vertebrates and viruses encode class V semaphorin.

However, recent management measures have restricted the availability of horseshoe crabs to commercial fisheries, creating the need for sustainable, alternative bait sources. In this study, we examined the chemistry underlying the predator-prey attraction to determine if specific, isolable attractant metabolites from the horseshoe crab could be identified and characterized for incorporation into an artifical bait. Initial assays with the mud snail, Hyanassa obsoleta, suggested that the chemoattractants were concentrated in L. polyphemus eggs. Chemical analyses and biological assays of the egg extract indicated the primary cue was a heat-stable, proteinaceous compound (>10 kDa). A carbohydrate-rich fraction of low molecular mass (< 10 kDa) also enhanced mud snail chemotaxis. Analysis of egg digests with SDS-PAGE confirmed the presence of glycoproteins or carbohydrate-binding proteins in the horseshoe crab egg extract. Because the attractant appears to be a complex protein or glycoprotein, conventional chemical synthesis is unlikely. However, the tools of modem biotechnology offer the potential to produce this attractant in a system independent of the horseshoe crab. Such an attractant could be incorporated into an artificial bait, providing an ecologically sound alternative for commercial eel and whelk fisheries.",10.1023/a:1022698431776,
332,Do weak adapting backgrounds uncover multiple components in the electroretinogram of the horseshoe crab?,"J C Lucas, W W Weiner, J Ahmed",2003,"The lateral eye of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, has been used as a model system for over a century to study visual and circadian processes. One advantage of this system is the relative simplicity of the retina. The input pathway of the retina consists of photoreceptor cells that are electrically coupled to the dendrite of a second-order cell, which sends action potentials to the brain. Electroretinograms (ERGs) recorded from the lateral eye show a biphasic shape, with a leading negative wave and a later positive peak. The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether adapting backgrounds could be used to uncover multiple adaptation mechanisms within the ERG. To test this idea, ERGs were elicited using variable intensity flashes presented under dark-adapted conditions, as well as in the presence of weak adapting backgrounds. Flashes and backgrounds were generated using green LEDs (lambda max = 525 nm) under software control. ERGs were recorded using a corneal wick electrode placed on the lateral eye of the horseshoe crab. Preliminary results suggest that ERGs recorded in the presence of adapting backgrounds are linearly scaled versions of dark-adapted FRGs. This suggests that there is a single adaptation stage in the Limulus retina. This is in contrast with analogous results from mammals, including mouse, cat and monkey, which show multiple stages of adaptation within their more complex retinas.",,

On exposure to gram-negative bacteria or their endotoxins, the amebocytes degranulate, releasing the clotting protein coagulogen and a number of proteases. The protease cascade converts the soluble coagulogen to insoluble coagulin, which forms fibrous clots that seal off the site of infection. The first description of this clotting reaction in the 1950s initiated development of Limulus amebocyte lysate and spurred an intensive study of the amebocytes. However, the site or sites and timing of amebocyte production have yet to be determined. We report here that during embryonic development in Limulus polyphemus, amebocyte production begins at stage 18.

Granules present in these cells are sensitive to nanogram quantities of bacterial endotoxins, which form the basis of the Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) test. Normally, amoebocytes for the production of the LAL are collected by cardiac puncture; hence, development of the in vitro culture system for amoebocytes will reduce the variability of the lysate and help to conserve the 400 million-yr-old living fossil. In the present investigation we have attempted organ culture of gill flaps that have been shown to be the source of amoebocytes. The gill flaps were cultured at 28 degrees C on a rocker platform in a modified L-15 medium supplemented with 10% v/v horseshoe crab serum. This led to the release of amoebocytes outside the gill flaps for a period of 6-8 wk with a more or less steady number of amoebocytes during the weekly harvest. No significant difference was seen in the yield of amoebocytes from male and female horseshoe crabs. Confocal laser microscopy studies revealed significant difference in the size of amoebocytes released in vitro as compared with those obtained in vivo. Thus, we have optimized the culture conditions for the long-term generation of amoebocytes in vitro from the Indian horseshoe crab Tachypleus gigas by reducing the incidence of contamination, simulating in vivo conditions for the organ culture of gill flaps, and improvising the nutritional status using the modified L-15 medium, providing the desired osmolarity and pH.",10.1290/1071-2690(2002)038<0255:LTIVGO>2.0.CO;2,

All of the antibodies obtained reacted with the same protein bands on SDS-PAGE of hemocyte lysate. Flow cytometry and biotinylation of surface substances on the hemocytes indicated that the antigens are major peripheral proteins of hemocytes. The antigens were purified from hemocyte lysate and were good substrates for the horseshoe crab hemocyte transglutaminase (HcTGase). Transglutaminases play an important role during the final stage of blood coagulation in mammals and crustaceans. Although HcTGase did not intermolecularly cross-link a clottable protein coagulogen or its proteolytic product coagulin, HcTGase promoted the cross-linking of coagulin with the surface antigens, resulting in the formation of a stable polymer. We determined the nucleotide sequences for two isoproteins of the antigens. The two proteins containing 271 and 284 residues (66% identity) were composed of tandem repeats of proline-rich segments.

Previous studies suggest that the three species constitute a phylogenetically unresolvable trichotomy, the result of a cladogenetic process leading to the formation of all three Indo-Pacific species in a short geological time. Data from two mitochondrial genes (for 16S ribosomal rRNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit I) and one nuclear gene (for coagulogen) in the four species of horseshoe crabs and outgroup species were used in a phylogenetic analysis with various substitution models.

Four experiments were conducted during which the lateral eye was exposed to one of a variety of different illumination patterns for a day, fixed, dissected and cut into serial frozen sections. Immunocytochemistry with different antibodies to Limulus opsin and arrestin revealed the results of the two processes in a distinguishable way. Eyes stimulated with whole-eye illumination had both types of shedding or just light-driven shedding when transient shedding was blocked by cutting the optic nerve. Eyes exposed to whole-eye darkness had neither type of shedding. However, when only half of an eye was exposed to light, the dark half had the same kinds of shedding as the lighted half.

Among three domains in subunit alpha of factor G, identified as the glucan-binding domain, was the COOH-terminal xylanase Z-like domain composed of two tandem-repeating units, each of which exhibits sequence similarities to the cellulose-binding domains of bacterial xylanases. Each of the single units bound to the glucan with lower affinities, and the association constant increased two orders with the tandem-repeating structure (K(a) = 8.0 x 10(8) m(-1)). In addition to longer glucans, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan oligosaccharides incapable of activating factor G bound also to factor G and competitively inhibited the zymogen activation. The minimum structure required for the binding was a (1-->3)-beta-d-glucan disaccharide, indicating that conformation-dependent structures are not essential for the recognition. Therefore, increasing avidity by multivalent binding sites with low affinities to simple structures on biologically active polymers may be one of the principles that allows stable and specific recognition of pathogens by pattern recognition receptors in innate immunity.",10.1074/jbc.M200177200,

346,"Categorical and prolonged potentials are evoked when brief, intermediate-intensity flashes stimulate horseshoe crab lateral eye photoreceptors during octopamine neuromodulation.","C C Lim, G S Wasserman",2001,"Octopamine, a major efferent neurotransmitter in the lateral eye of the horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus), has previously been shown to modulate photoreceptor responses evoked by long flashes. Quantification of these data indicates that this modulation produced a genuine increase in sensitivity to light which cannot be entirely due to an increase in optical efficiency consequent on an anatomical alteration. Other previous studies demonstrated that extrinsic current can modulate Limulus lateral eye photoreceptor cells by inducing a bistable membrane potential with two distinct states. The present study was therefore undertaken to find out if octopamine could modulate visual responses by inducing prolonged and bistable polarization shifts similar to those demonstrated in several other neural systems. Intracellular microelectrodes were used to execute an electrophysiological study of the receptor potentials evoked in the lateral eye of Limulus when brief (20-ms) flashes were delivered while 50 microM octopamine perfused dark-adapted photoreceptors. The combined chemical and optical stimuli prolonged photoreceptor responses to light to the degree that they often exceeded the duration of the brief stimulus by hundreds of milliseconds. Moreover, these prolonged potentials were clearly bistable because they were categorical--either a prolongation was perceptually clear-cut and present or it was not, with no intermediate patterns being observed. During seawater control perfusions, such prolongations were absent. This appears to be the first demonstration of such categorical and prolonged potentials in a photoreceptor neuron. This finding particularly suggests that efferent-driven neuromodulation can enable the development of a persisting short-term representation of a brief stimulus, with this representation being retained at the most distal possible neural site.",10.1159/000046907,

Recent evidence has shown that a mammalian Toll-like receptor (TLR) is activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The innate immunity in invertebrates is also triggered by LPS, as seen in the hemolymph coagulation in horseshoe crab. We report the cloning of a TLR from the Japanese horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus. A cDNA coding for Tachypleus Toll was isolated from a hemocyte cDNA library and the open reading frame codes for a proprotein including a signal sequence. Like Drosophila Toll, Tachypleus Toll is a type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain consisting of two leucine-rich repeats flanked by two cystein-rich clusters and a cytoplasmic domain exhibiting striking similarity with the cytoplasmic domain of interleukin-1 receptor.

However, they are equipped with a structurally similar oxygen-binding center. We have shown that the clotting enzyme of the horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus, functionally converts hemocyanin to phenoloxidase by forming a complex without proteolytic cleavage (Nagai, T., and Kawabata, S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 35297-35301). Here we show that chitin-binding antimicrobial peptides of the horseshoe crab induce the intrinsic phenoloxidase activity of hemocyanin. Tachyplesin, a major Tachypleus antimicrobial peptide with an amphiphilic structure, converted the hemocyanin to phenoloxidase. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed the specific interaction of tachyplesin with hemocyanin at K(d) = 3.4 x 10(-)6 m. The chemical modification of Trp or Tyr in tachyplesin, but not Lys or Arg, dramatically reduced the affinity to hemocyanin, suggesting that the binding site is located in the hydrophobic face of tachyplesin. Hemocyanin has no affinity with chitin, but it significantly binds to tachyplesin-coated chitin, leading to the expression of phenoloxidase activity. The chitin coated with antimicrobial peptides may serve as a scaffold for the binding of hemocyanin, and the resulting phenoloxidase activity appears to function as a trigger of exoskeleton wound healing.",10.1074/jbc.M102596200,

The effective prevention measures are not eating Horseshoe crab, especially the young ones. The size of young Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda is similar to the size of the nonpoisonous Tachypleus tridentatuscause. It is very easy to be confused and easy to eat by mistake.

Sushi1 and 3 each has a high-affinity LPS binding site with K:(d) of 10(-9) to 10(-10) M. Positive cooperativity in sushi123 resulted in a 1000-fold increase in K:(d)2. The core LPS binding region of sushi1 and 3 reside in two 34-mer peptides, S1 and S3. A rigidly held disulfide-bonded structure is not essential but is important for LPS binding, as confirmed by a 100- to 10000-fold decrease in affinity. Both S1 and S3 can inhibit LAL reaction and LPS-induced hTNF-alpha secretion with different potency. LAL assay revealed that at least two molecules of S1 bind cooperatively to one LPS molecule, with Hill's coefficient of 2.42. The LPS binding by S3 is independent and noncooperative. The modified SDelta1 and SDelta3 peptides exhibited increased LPS neutralization potential although its LPS binding affinities indicated only a 10-fold improvement. Hence, the structural difference of the four sushi peptides conferred different efficiencies in LPS neutralization without altering their binding affinity for LPS. Circular dichroism spectrometry revealed that the four peptides underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to either an alpha-helical or beta-sheet structure. Two factors are critical for the sensitivity of Factor C to LPS: 1) the presence of multiple binding sites for LPS on a single Factor C molecule; and 2) high positive cooperativity in LPS binding. The results showed that in the design of an improved LPS binding and neutralizing peptide, charge balance of the peptide is a critical parameter in addition to its structure.",10.1096/fj.99-0866com,

Here we identified binding sites for the polymerization. A tryptic fragment, derived from the coagulin polymer chemically cross-linked by a bifunctional cross-linker, was isolated. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the fragment consists of two peptides cross-linked between Lys(85) and Lys(156). The two lysine residues are oppositely located at the head and tail regions of the elongated molecule separated by a much greater distance than the length of the cross-linker, which suggests that the cross-linking occurs intermolecularly. Based on the x-ray structural analysis, exposure of a hydrophobic cove on the head in response to the release of peptide C has been postulated (Bergner, A., Oganessyan, V., Muta, T., Iwanaga, S., Typke, D., Huber, R., and Bode, W. (1996) EMBO J. 15, 6789-6797). An octapeptide containing Tyr(136), which occupies the tail end of coagulin, was found to inhibit the polymerization. Replacement of Tyr(136) of the peptide with Ala resulted in loss of the inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the polymerization of coagulin proceeds through the interaction between the newly exposed hydrophobic cove on the head and the wedge-shaped hydrophobic tail.",10.1074/jbc.M006856200,

The approximately 38 kDa protein represents the LPS binding domain of factor C. A novel secretory signal directs the secretion of SSCrFCES into the culture supernatant of Drosophila cells, and hence it is readily purified. By differential ultrafiltration followed by preparative isoelectric membrane electrophoresis, SSCrFCES was purified as an isoelectrically homogeneous and stable monomeric protein. The ability of SSCrFCES to bind lipid A was analyzed using an ELISA-based assay as well as surface plasmon resonance. SSCrFCES exhibits high positive cooperativity of binding to two or three lipid A molecules, with a Hill's coefficient of 2.2. The 50% endotoxin-neutralizing concentration of SSCrFCES against 200 EU of endotoxin is approximately 0.069 microM, suggesting that SSCrFCES is an effective inhibitor of LAL coagulation cascade. Although partially attenuated by human serum, as little as 1 microM of SSCrFCES inhibits the LPS-induced secretion of hTNF-alpha and hIL-8 by THP-1 and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with greater potency than polymyxin B. SSCrFCES is noncytotoxic, with a clearance rate of 4.7 ml/min. The L.D.(90) of SSCrFCES for LPS lethality is achieved at 2 microM.

364,The complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus.,"D V Lavrov, J L Boore, W M Brown",2000,"We determined the complete 14,985-nt sequence of the mitochondrial DNA of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus (Arthropoda: Xiphosura). This mtDNA encodes the 13 protein, 2 rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes typical for metazoans. The arrangement of these genes and about half of the sequence was reported previously; however, the sequence contained a large number of errors, which are corrected here. The two strands of Limulus mtDNA have significantly different nucleotide compositions. The strand encoding most mitochondrial proteins has 1. 25 times as many A's as T's and 2.33 times as many C's as G's. This nucleotide bias correlates with the biases in amino acid content and synonymous codon usage in proteins encoded by different strands and with the number of non-Watson-Crick base pairs in the stem regions of encoded tRNAs. The sizes of most mitochondrial protein genes in Limulus are either identical to or slightly smaller than those of their Drosophila counterparts. The usage of the initiation and termination codons in these genes seems to follow patterns that are conserved among most arthropod and some other metazoan mitochondrial genomes. The noncoding region of Limulus mtDNA contains a potential stem-loop structure, and we found a similar structure in the noncoding region of the published mtDNA of the prostriate tick Ixodes hexagonus. A simulation study was designed to evaluate the significance of these secondary structures; it revealed that they are statistically significant. No significant, comparable structure can be identified for the metastriate ticks Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Boophilus microplus. The latter two animals also share a mitochondrial gene rearrangement and an unusual structure of mt-tRNA(C) that is exactly the same association of changes as previously reported for a group of lizards. This suggests that the changes observed are not independent and that the stem-loop structure found in the noncoding regions of Limulus and Ixodes mtDNA may play the same role as that between trnN and trnC in vertebrates, i.e., the role of lagging strand origin of replication.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026360,

The haemolytic activity of limulin is inhibited by thiol ester-reacted forms of Limulus alpha(2)-macroglobulin, the third-most abundant protein of the plasma. Limulus alpha(2)-macroglobulin that has experienced cleavage of its internal thiol ester bond, consequent to reaction with proteases, or with the small primary amine, methylamine, reduces the haemolytic activity of limulin when present at molar excesses that approximate the relative concentrations of these two proteins in the plasma. Native, unreacted Limulus alpha(2)-macroglobulin has no effect on the haemolytic activity of limulin. Limulin binds thiol ester-reacted forms of Limulus alpha(2)-macroglobulin both in a solid-phase assay and in solution with an avidity 10-25 times higher than native, unreacted Limulus alpha(2)-macroglobulin. Protease-reacted alpha(2)-macroglobulin functions as a marker for the presence of foreign proteases in the blood of Limulus, and thus of pathogenic organisms that release proteases as facilitators of invasion and pathogenicity. Modulation of the haemolytic system represents a novel function for alpha(2)-macroglobulin.",,

TL-P preferentially agglutinated human A-type erythrocytes, and the activity was inhibited by N-acetyl group-containing monosaccharides. The amino acid sequence analysis indicated that TL-P is almost structurally the same as a hemocyte-derived lectin with no hemagglutinating activity, tachylectin-1 (TL-1), and that 218 out of 221 amino acid residues in total were conserved between the two lectins. Despite the high sequence similarity, biological and biochemical characteristics of TL-P differed from those of TL-1: (i) unlike TL-1, TL-P agglutinates several animal-derived erythrocytes; (ii) unlike TL-1, TL-P has no significant affinity for bacterial lipopolysaccharides or antibacterial activity; (iii) Based on apparent molecular masses determined by gel filtration, TL-P forms a dimer in solution, while TL-1 is present as a monomer; (iv) and TL-P interacts with endogenous proteins of 13 and 14 kDa present in the perivitelline fluid; however, neither has any affinity for TL-1.

We have now identified three types of C-reactive protein in the plasma of the Japanese horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus), based on different affinities against fetuin-agarose and phosphorylethanolamine-agarose determined by quantitative precipitin assays using fetuin and an artificial phosphorylethanolamine-protein conjugate. Partial amino acid sequences of the isolated C-reactive proteins identified homologous proteins which were named Tachypleus tridentatus CRP-1 (tCRP-1), tCRP-2 and tCRP-3, each of which possibly constitute isoprotein mixtures. tCRP-2 and tCRP-3, but not tCRP-1, agglutinated mammalian erythrocytes. tCRP-1, the most abundant C-reative protein in the plasma, exhibited the highest affinity to the phosphorylethanolamine-protein conjugate but lacked both sialic-acid-binding and hemolytic activities. tCRP-2 bound to both fetuin-agarose and phosphorylethanolamine-agarose, and exhibited Ca2+-dependent hemolytic and sialic-acid-binding activities, suggestive of limulin-like properties. Furthermore, tCRP-2 exhibited a higher affinity to colominic acid, a bacterial polysialic acid. By contrast, tCRP-3 shows stronger hemolytic, sialic-acid-binding and hemagglutinating activities than tCRP-2. tCRP-3 has no affinity to phosphorylethanolamine-agarose, phosphorylethanolamine-protein conjugate and colominic acid. This suggests tCRP-3 is a novel hemolytic C-reactive protein lacking a common characteristic of phosphorylethanolamine-agarose binding affinity. Twenty-two clones of tCRPs with different deduced amino acid sequences were obtained by PCR using oligonucleotide primers based on the N-terminal and C-terminal sequences of tCRPs and with templates including genomic DNA and cDNA of hemocytes or hepatopancreas derived from one individual. The translation products of the tCRP clones possess high molecular diversity which falls into three related groups, consistent with classification based on their biological activities. Only tCRP-3 contained a unique hydrophobic nonapeptide sequence that appears in the transmembrane domain of a major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain of rainbow trout, suggesting the importance of the hydrophobic patch to the hemolytic activity of tCRP-3.

Tachystatins caused morphological changes against a budding yeast, and tachystatin C had a strong cell lysis activity. The septum between mother cell and bud, a chitin-rich region, was stained by fluorescence-labeled tachystatin C, suggesting that the primary recognizing substance on the cell wall is chitin.

Tachylectin-1 interacts with Gram-negative bacteria probably through 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate, one of the constituents of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Tachylectin-1 also binds to polysaccharides such as agarose and dextran with broad specificity. Tachylectin-2 binds to D-GlcNAc or D-GalNAc and recognizes staphylococcal lipoteichoic acids and LPS from several Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast, tachylectins-3 and -4 specifically bind to S-type LPS from several Gram-negative bacteria through a certain sugar moiety on the O-specific polysaccharides (O-antigens). Tachylectin-5 identified in hemolymph plasma has the strongest bacterial agglutinating activity in the five types of tachylectins, and exhibits broad specificity against acetyl group-containing substances. Thus, the innate immune system of horseshoe crab may recognize invading pathogens through a combinatorial method using lectins with different specificities against carbohydrates exposed on pathogens. An encounter of these lectins derived from hemocytes and hemolymph plasma at injured sites, in response to the stimulation of LPS, suggests that they serve synergistically to accomplish an effective host defense against invading microbes and foreign substances.",10.1016/s0145-305x(99)00019-1,

The binding sites are located between adjacent beta-sheets and are made by a large loop between the outermost strands of the beta-sheets and the connecting segment from the previous beta-sheet. The high number of five binding sites within the single polypeptide chain strongly suggests the recognition of carbohydrate surface structures of pathogens with a fairly high ligand density. Thus, tachylectin-2 employs strict specificity for certain N-acetyl sugars as well as the surface ligand density for self/non-self recognition.",10.1093/emboj/18.9.2313,
376,"Cellular distributions and functions of histamine, octopamine, and serotonin in the peripheral visual system, brain, and circumesophageal ring of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus.","B A Battelle, B G Calman, M K Hart",1999,"The data reviewed here show that histamine, octopamine, and serotonin are abundant in the visual system of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus. Anatomical and biochemical evidence, including new biochemical data presented here, indicates that histamine is a neurotransmitter in primary retinal afferents, and that it may be involved in visual information processing within the lateral eye. The presence of histamine in neurons of the central nervous system outside of the visual centers suggests that this amine also has functions unrelated to vision. However, the physiological actions of histamine in the Limulus nervous system are not yet known. Octopamine is present in and released from the axons of neurons that transmit circadian information from the brain to the eyes, and octopamine mimics the actions of circadian input on many retinal functions. In addition, octopamine probably has major functions in other parts of the nervous system as octopamine immunoreactive processes are widely distributed in the central nervous system and in peripheral motor nerves. Indeed, octopamine modulates functions of the heart and exoskeletal muscles as well as the eyes. A surprising finding is that although octopamine is a circulating neurohormone in Limulus, there is no structural evidence for its release into the hemolymph from central sites. The distribution of serotonin in Limulus brain suggests this amine modulates the central processing of visual information. Serotonin modulates cholinergic synapses in the central nervous system, but nothing further is known about its physiological actions.",10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19990115/01)44:2/3<70::AID-JEMT2>3.0.CO;2-V,
377,A newly identified horseshoe crab lectin with specificity for blood group A antigen recognizes specific O-antigens of bacterial lipopolysaccharides.,"K Inamori, T Saito, D Iwaki, T Nagira, S Iwanaga, F Arisaka, S Kawabata",1999,"A 14-kDa lectin, named tachylectin-3, was newly identified from hemocytes of the Japanese horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus. This lectin exhibited hemagglutinating activity against human A-type erythrocytes, but not against the B- and O-types of erythrocytes and animal erythrocytes, including those of sheep, rabbit, horse, and bovine. The hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-3 was equivalent to that of a previously identified lectin, named tachylectin-2, with affinity for N-acetyl-D-glucosamine or N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. However, the activity of tachylectin-3 was not inhibited by these two N-acetylhexosamines at 100 mM but was inhibited by a blood group A-pentasaccharide at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.16 mM. Furthermore, the hemagglutinating activity was strongly inhibited by bacterial S-type lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from Gram-negative bacteria but not by R-type LPSs lacking O-antigens. One of the most effective S-type LPSs was from Escherichia coli O111:B4, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 6 ng/ml. These data suggest that tachylectin-3 specifically recognizes Gram-negative bacteria through the unique structural units of O-antigens. Ultracentrifugation analysis revealed that tachylectin-3 is present in dimer in solution. A cDNA coding for tachylectin-3 was isolated from a hemocyte cDNA library. Tachylectin-3 consisted of two repeating sequences, each with a partial sequence similarity to rinderpest virus neuraminidase. Tachylectin-3 and three previously isolated types of tachylectins were all predominantly expressed in hemocytes and released from hemocytes in response to external stimuli. These lectins present at injured sites suggest that they probably serve synergistically to accomplish an effective host defense against invading microbes.",10.1074/jbc.274.6.3272,

The total fatty acid composition of the cells' lipids was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). The FAME analysis revealed high levels of 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially arachidonic (20:4n-6) and eicosapentaenoic (20:5n-3) acids. Almost 20% of the total lipid profile was comprised of dimethyl acetals of 16- to 20-carbon chain lengths, indicative of plasmalogens in the phospholipid pool. Phospholipids, analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography, included phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), sphingomyelin (SPH), and cardiolipin (CL). PE and PC levels predominated at 42.2 and 36.3%, respectively. Smaller amounts of PS (9.0%) and PI (6.2%) were present, as well as low levels of SPH (4.6%), CL (1.6%), and trace amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine. The major phospholipid species, PE, PC, PS and PI, were collected and their molecular species were examined by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry. The molecular species within the phospholipid classes reflected the high levels of PUFA seen in the total lipid profile. PI was mainly composed of 18:0a/20:4. Over half of the PS consisted of 18:0a/18:1 and 18:0a/20:4. The major PE species were 20:1p/20:5, 20:1p/20:4, 18:0p/20:5, and 18:0p/20:4. PC had the largest distribution of molecular species, and its most abundant species were 16:0e/20:5, 16:0e/20:4, and 16:0p/20:4. The presence of 16:0e/20:4 is the first documentation of a specific precursor to platelet-activating factor in an invertebrate hemocyte.

379,Heavy metals inhibit limb regeneration in horseshoe crab larvae.,"T Itow, T Igarashi, ML Botton, RE Loveland",1998,"We studied the effects of heavy metals on the regeneration of walking legs in horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The second walking leg was amputated in embryos (stage 20 and 21) and first instar (trilobite) larvae, and the length and morphology of the regenerated appendage was observed after molting to the second instar stage. Regeneration following continuous exposure to TBT (0. 001-100 mg/L), mercury (0.001-100 mg/L), cadmium (0.01-100 mg/L), chromium (0.1-100 mg/L), lead (0.1-100 mg/L), and copper (1-100 mg/L) was measured relative to regeneration in seawater. Although regeneration was incomplete in controls, treatment with heavy metals led to smaller and/or malformed legs. The impacts of heavy metals on survival, molting, and regeneration of horseshoe crab larvae were ranked as follows: organotin > Hg > Cd > Cr > Zn > Pb >== Cu. Cu and Pb did not inhibit regeneration, even at 100 mg/L. TBT, Hg, Cd, Cr, and Zn inhibited the regeneration of appendages, although first instar larvae successfully molted into second instars even after treatment. Regeneration was comparable to seawater controls in less than 2.5 mg/L Zn. In 5.0 and 10.0 mg/L Zn, regeneration was inhibited and the length of regenerated appendages remained shorter in all second instars. Larvae treated with 10 mg/L Zn for 1-week intervals during the molt cycle showed similar patterns of regeneration. The regeneration of claws was not all or none, and formation of the claw was proportional to the length of regenerated appendages. Limb regeneration in horseshoe crab larvae may be a useful model system for the study of pollutant impacts.",10.1007/s002449900402,
380,Evolution and phylogeny of defense molecules associated with innate immunity in horseshoe crab.,"S Iwanaga, S Kawabata",1998,"This short review describes the molecular evolution and phylogeny of various defense molecules participating in the host defense of horseshoe crab. It is well known that invertebrate animals, which lack adaptive immune systems, have developed various defense systems, so called innate immunity, that respond to common antigens on the surface of potential pathogens. The systems include hemolymph coagulation, melanization, cell agglutination, antimicrobial action, active oxygen formation, and phagocytic action. Among them, hemolymph coagulation and phenoloxidase-mediated melanization, in addition to cell agglutination, are directly induced by foreign substances, that result in the engulfment of invading microbes. The immobilized invaders are finally killed by antimicrobial substances released mainly from many kinds of hemocytes. In the past two decades, we have investigated biochemically various defense molecules, using horseshoe crab as a model animal, and established extensively their molecular structures. These results now make it possible to discuss evolution and phylogeny of the defense molecules at a molecular level, in comparison with those derived from vertebrate animals. Here, the authors will describe the present state of our knowledge concerning molecules mainly associated with innate immunity.",10.2741/a337,
381,"Alpha2-macroglobulin does not function as a C3 homologue in the plasma hemolytic system of the American horseshoe crab, Limulus.","P B Armstrong, R Melchior, S Swarnakar, J P Quigley",1998,"A major problem of comparative immunology is the characterization of the internal defense systems that lyse foreign cells, such as bacteria and other microbial pathogens that have gained entry into the body. The plasma cytolytic system of the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, is sensitive to treatment with methylamine, which inactivates the abundant plasma defense protein alpha2-macroglobulin. This has been interpreted to mean that alpha2-macroglobulin plays an important role in hemolysis, analogous to the role of complement component C3 of the mammalian complement system (Enghild et al., 1990). Sensitivity to methylamine has been suggested to reflect an evolutionary homology with the plasma cytolytic system of mammals, in which the complement system is inactivated by the reaction of methylamine with complement components C3 and C4. C3, C4 and alpha2-macroglobulin contain an internal thiol ester bond linking cysteinyl and glutamic acid residues and methylamine inactivates all three proteins by reaction with the thiol-esterified glutamic acid. However, we have recently shown that the principal effector of hemolysis in Limulus is the plasma lectin, limulin (Armstrong et al., 1996). In this article we show that native, unreacted alpha2-macroglobulin is not involved directly in hemolysis but instead that methylamine-reacted alpha2-macroglobulin inhibits the hemolytic activity of limulin. Thus the thiol ester proteins alpha2-macroglobulin and C3 operate very differently in the hemolytic systems of Limulus and mammals and are not functionally homologous. Limulus alpha2-macroglobulin functions indirectly in hemolysis: its inactivation yields an inhibitory molecule for limulin-mediated hemolysis.",10.1016/s0161-5890(98)00007-8,
382,Developmental abnormalities in horseshoe crab embryos caused by exposure to heavy metals.,"T Itow, RE Loveland, ML Botton",1998,"We examined the effects of heavy metals on the development of horseshoe crabs using bioassays in which embryos at different stages were exposed either continuously or for 24 h. Abnormalities included segment-defective embryos, double embryos, embryos with abnormal eye areas, and no-posterior embryos. In terms of their ability to affect normal development, the pollutants are ranked as follows: Hg >== organotin > Cr falling dots Cd > Cu > Pb > Zn. Organotin treatment was associated with a high frequency of abnormal eye embryos and Hg with segment-defective embryos. The specific cause of segment-defective malformations by Hg was investigated by using SH inhibitors and cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of microfilaments. These inhibitors induced Hg-type segment-defective embryos; thus, Hg may also act by inhibiting SH-SS exchange and blocking morphogenetic movements. Horseshoe crab embryos from Delaware Bay and Sandy Hook Bay, New Jersey, were examined for developmental abnormalities. Malformed embryos were extremely rare (<0.6%) at five beaches along Delaware Bay as well as Sandy Hook Bay, suggesting that these horseshoe crab spawning areas are relatively unpolluted by heavy metals.",10.1007/s002449900345,

Animals were exposed to nominal metal concentrations from 0.01 to 1,000 mg/L for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, or continuously until the endpoint for the study (successful molting or death) was reached. Larvae showed greater tolerance of Cu and Zn than embryos. Under most treatment regimes, embryos and larvae were able to survive and molt in the presence of up to 100 mg/L Cu or Zn. Unexpectedly, horseshoe crabs from the more heavily polluted site (Sandy Hook Bay) were more susceptible to heavy metals than animals from a less polluted site (lower Delaware Bay). Horseshoe crab embryos and larvae were highly resistant to heavy metals in comparison to marine crustacea. The ability of Limulus embryos and larvae to survive in the presence of heavy metals implies the potential for these contaminants to be passed on to shorebirds and other predators.",10.1007/s002449900344,
384,New types of clotting factors and defense molecules found in horseshoe crab hemolymph: their structures and functions.,"S Iwanaga, S Kawabata, T Muta",1998,"Invertebrate animals, which lack adaptive immune systems, have developed defense systems, so-called innate immunity, that respond to common antigens on the surface of potential pathogens. One such defense system is involved in the cellular responses of horseshoe crab hemocytes to invaders. Hemocytes contain two types, large (L) and small (S), of secretory granules, and the contents of these granules are released in response to invading microbes via exocytosis. Recent biochemical and immunological studies on the granular components of L- and S-granules demonstrated that the two types of granules selectively store granule-specific proteins participating in the host defense systems. L-Granules contain all the clotting factors essential for hemolymph coagulation, protease inhibitors including serpins and cystatin, and anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) factor and several tachylectins with LPS binding and bacterial agglutinating activities. On the other hand, S-granules contain various new cysteine-rich basic proteins with antimicrobial or bacterial agglutinating activities, such as tachyplesins, big defensin, tachycitin, and tachystatins. The co-localization of these proteins in the granules and their release into the hemolymph suggest that they serve synergistically to construct an effective host defense system against invaders. Here, the structures and functions of these new types of defense molecules found in the Japanese horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) are reviewed.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021894,
385,A newly identified horseshoe crab lectin with binding specificity to O-antigen of bacterial lipopolysaccharides.,"T Saito, M Hatada, S Iwanaga, S Kawabata",1997,"We identified a novel horseshoe crab hemocyte-derived lectin, which we named tachylectin-4. It has more potent hemagglutinating activity against human A-type erythrocytes than a previously identified hemocyte lectin with an affinity to N-acetylglucosamine, tachylectin-2. The purified tachylectin-4 is an oligomeric glycoprotein of 470 kDa, composed of subunits of 30 and 31.5 kDa. Ca2+ at 10 mM enhanced the hemagglutinating activity 4-fold, and the activity was inhibited by EDTA and o-phenanthroline. L-Fucose and N-acetylneuraminic acid at 100 mM completely inhibited the activity of tachylectin-4. The activity was also inhibited more strongly by bacterial S-type lipopolysaccharides (LPS) but not by R-type LPS lacking O-antigen. The most effective S-type LPS was from Escherichia coli O111:B4, and the minimum concentration required for inhibiting agglutination against human A-type erythrocytes (0.1 microg/ml) was 160-fold lower than those of S-type LPS from Salmonella minnesota. Therefore, colitose (3-deoxy-L-fucose), a unique sugar present in the O-antigen of E. coli O111:B4 with structural similarity to L-fucose, is the most probable candidate for a specific ligand of tachylectin-4. A cDNA coding for tachylectin-4 was isolated from a hemocyte cDNA library. The open reading frame of the 1344-base pair cDNA coded for the mature protein with 232 amino acids. There is no significant sequence similarity to any other known LPS-binding lectins, whereas tachylectin-4 is homologous to the NH2-terminal domain with unknown functions of Xenopus laevis pentraxin 1.",10.1074/jbc.272.49.30703,

Each of four nephridial lobes consists of two cortical layers surrounding a medulla. The outer and inner cortexes contain blood vessels separated by a basement membrane from the urinary space lined by podocytes. Podocyte foot processes are applied to the basement membrane, interdigitate with those from other podocytes, and have a filtration slit diaphragm between them. Cortical morphology demonstrates ultrafiltration of blood, a previously undescribed function of the gland, as well as possible endocytic reabsorption of materials by the podocytes. The medulla drains into the stolon connecting the four lobes. These two areas have urinary tubules of cuboidal epithelium featuring microvillous-like apical projections, cytoplasmic vesicles and vacuoles, elaborate lateral interdigitations with septate junctions, and basal invaginations containing numerous mitochondria. These tubules are closely surrounded by blood channels, lined by a basement membrane containing embedded support cells. The medulla and stolon morphology are suggestive of both ion transport and water movement, in keeping with the gland's role in osmoregulation. The stolon empties into the end sac in the base of the most posterior lobe. It is lined by tall epithelium exhibiting apical overlap, blunt projections into the lumen, apparent endocytic vesicles, and basal plasma membrane infoldings with mitochondria. The end sac drains into the conducting nephric duct, the proximal end of which is lined by a cuticle. J.

Most mitochondrial gene arrangements reported for crustaceans and insect species are identical or nearly identical to that of Drosophila yakuba. Sequences across 36 of the gene boundaries in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of a representative chelicerate. Limulus polyphemus L., also reveal an arrangement like that of Drosophila yakuba. Only the position of the tRNA(LEU)(UUR) gene differs; in Limulus it is between the genes for tRNA(LEU)(CUN) and ND1. This positioning is also found in onychophorans, mollusks, and annelids, but not in insects and crustaceans, and indicates that tRNA(LEU)(CUN)-tRNA(LEU)(UUR)-ND1 was the ancestral gene arrangement for these groups, as suggested earlier. There are no differences in the relative arrangements of protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes between Limulus and Drosophila, and none have been observed within arthropods. The high degree of similarity of mitochondrial gene arrangements within arthropods is striking, since some taxa last shared a common ancestor before the Cambrian, and contrasts with the extensive mtDNA rearrangements occasionally observed within some other metazoan phyla (e.g., mollusks and nematodes).",10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025828,

It is mediated by the clotting cascade system which consists of four serine proteinase zymogens and the clottable protein coagulogen. Coagulogen, the target protein of the cascade, is converted to an insoluble gel upon activation of the cascade, giving rise to clot formation. Thus this cascade is reminiscent of the mammalian blood coagulation leading to fibrin clot. The structural analysis of coagulogen revealed a polypeptide fold and disulfide bridge pattern in the C-terminal half of the molecule very similar to nerve growth factor (NGF). This finding assigns coagulogen as the first structurally characterized invertebrate protein which belongs to the cystine knot superfamily. The putative structural similarity of coagulogen and the Drosophila morphogen Spaetzle as well as the homology of its processing proteinases suggests a common origin of the two functionally different cascades.

The cascade results in the conversion of coagulogen, a soluble protein, into an insoluble coagulin gel. The clotting enzyme excises the fragment peptide C from coagulogen, giving rise to aggregation of the monomers. The crystal structure of coagulogen reveals an elongated molecule that embraces the helical peptide C fragment. Cleavage and removal of the peptide C would expose an extended hydrophobic cove, which could interact with the hydrophobic edge of a second molecule, leading to a polymeric fibre. The C-terminal half of the coagulogen molecule exhibits a striking topological similarity to the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF), providing the first evidence for a neurotrophin fold in invertebrates. Similarities between coagulogen and Spatzle, the Drosophila ligand of the receptor Toll, suggest that the neurotrophin fold might be considered more ancient and widespread than previously realized.",,

In this study we used molecular and immunochemical techniques to characterize a GTP-binding protein alpha subunit of the Gq family in ventral and lateral photoreceptors of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. Both ventral photoreceptors and lateral eye retinular cells became strongly labeled with an antibody directed against the common carboxyl tail of two Gq family proteins, G alpha q and G alpha 11. This antibody also labeled a 42 kDa band on Western blots of proteins from ventral photoreceptor cell bodies, ventral photoreceptor axons, lateral eyes and lateral optic nerves.

Ribonuclease protection assays showed that the corresponding message was expressed in ventral eye, but these assays, as well as Northern blots, failed to detect expression in lateral eye.

398,"Tachycitin, a small granular component in horseshoe crab hemocytes, is an antimicrobial protein with chitin-binding activity.","S Kawabata, R Nagayama, M Hirata, T Shigenaga, K L Agarwala, T Saito, J Cho, H Nakajima, T Takagi, S Iwanaga",1996,"Small granules of horseshoe crab hemocytes contain two known major antimicrobial substances, tachyplesin and big defensin (S5), and at least five protein components (S1 to S6), with unknown functions. In the present study, we examined the biological properties and primary structure of a small granular component S2, named tachycitin. This component was purified from the acid extract of hemocyte debris by two steps of chromatography. The purified tachycitin was a single chain protein with an apparent M(r) = 8,500 on Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Ultracentrifugation analysis revealed tachycitin to be present in monomer form in solution. Tachycitin inhibited the growth of both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, and fungi, with a bacterial agglutinating property. Moreover, tachycitin and big defensin acted synergistically in antimicrobial activities. The amino acid sequence and intrachain disulfide bonds of tachycitin were determined by amino acid and sequence analyses of peptides produced by enzymatic cleavages. The mature tachycitin consisted of 73 amino acid residues containing five disulfide bonds with no N-linked sugar. A cDNA coding for tachycitin was isolated from a hemocyte cDNA library. The open reading frame coded for an NH2-terminal signal sequence followed by the mature peptide and an extension sequence of -Gly-Arg-Lys at the COOH-terminus, which is a putative amidating signal. The COOH-terminal threonine amide released after digestion of tachycitin with lysylendopeptidase was identified. The NH2-terminal 28 residues of tachycitin shows sequence homology to a part of chitin-binding regions found in antifungal chitin-binding peptides, chitin-binding lectins, and chitinases, all of which have been isolated from plants. Tachycitin showed a specific binding to chitin but did not bind with the polysaccharides cellulose, mannan, xylan, and laminarin. Tachycitin may represent a new class of chitin-binding protein family in animals.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021549,
399,Ultrastructure and Transport-Related Enzymes of the Gills and Coxal Gland of the Horseshoe Crab Limulus polyphemus.,"R P Henry, S A Jackson, C P Mangum",1996,"The horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, may be unique among marine arthropods in that both its book gills and its coxal gland may serve as sites of ion transport. We have therefore examined the ultrastructure of these organs, as well as the distribution and relative levels of two major transport-related enzymes: the Na+ + K+ ATPase and carbonic anhydrase (CA). The ventral surface of the central region of each lamella shows the typical ultrastructural specializations for ion transport: 10 μm cell thickness, an extensive network of tubules originating from infoldings of the basal membrane, and a high density of mitochondria. This region also contains high levels of activity of the Na+ + K+ ATPase and CA. The distribution of ion transporting epithelium and transport enzymes is identical in each of the five gill books. The peripheral region of the lamellae of each gill book is specialized for passive gas exchange. The ultrastructural and biochemical profile of the coxal gland is similar to that of the central-ventral region of the gill. Limulus possesses the same general mechanism of ion regulation seen in euryhaline decapod crustaceans, but the structural and functional components are uniquely distributed.",10.2307/1542927,

The domain organization is very similar to that of the yeast Kex2 except that limulus kexin does not have a cytoplasmic tail. The catalytic domain exhibits striking sequence identities with those of furins, especially Drosophila furin1 (79%).

403,Expression of horseshoe crab arginine kinase in Escherichia coli and site-directed mutations of the reactive cysteine peptide.,"S J Strong, W R Ellington",1996,"Arginine kinase (AK) from the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus was expressed in Escherichia coli. The bulk of expressed protein resided in insoluble inclusion bodies. However, approximately 3 mg enzyme protein/l culture was present as active soluble AK. The AK-containing expression vector construct was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis via a polymerase chain reaction-based megaprimer protocol. The AK reactive cysteine peptide was engineered so that it was identical to the corresponding peptide sequence of creatine kinase, another member of the guanidino kinase enzyme family. The resulting expressed protein had a considerably reduced specific activity but was still specific for arginine/arginine phosphate. No catalytic activity was observed with other guanidine substrates (creatine, glycocyamine, taurocyamine, lombricine).

However, in the living fossil, horseshoe crab, it has been claimed that the prophenoloxidase system widely found in the hemolymph of most arthropods is absent. On the contrary, we present evidence for the presence of a prophenoloxidase system in the hemolymph of Limulus and a method to study its activation. Activation of prophenoloxidase was achieved by treatment with either the anionic detergent, SDS, or the cationic detergent, cetylpyridinium chloride. The detergents seemed to bind to the proenzyme below their critical micellar concentration and induce conformational changes that cause the activation of prophenoloxidase. In addition, a number of fatty acids and phospholipids also activated the prophenoloxidase. Proteases such as trypsin activated the enzyme only marginally. The approximate molecular weight of the proenzyme was found to be 70,000. Substrate specificity studies, product analysis and inhibition experiments revealed that the Limulus enzyme is a typical o-diphenoloxidase. The possible reasons for the failure to detect the phenoloxidase activity by earlier workers are discussed.",10.1016/0305-0491(95)02047-0,

L-cystatin inhibits amidolytic activity of papain by forming a noncovalent 1:1 complex with an equilibrium constant (Ki) of 0.08 nM. It also inhibits cathepsin L (Ki = 0.17 nM) and ficin (Ki = 0.52 nM), but not argingipain (a bacterial cysteine protease) and calpains. A cDNA for L-cystatin was isolated and the open reading frame coded for a mature protein of 114 amino acids, of which 99 residues were confirmed by peptide sequencing. L-cystatin shows significant sequence identities to members of the family 2 cystatin, such as bovine colostrum cystatin (33%) and human cystatin S (31%). Northern blotting revealed expression of the mRNA in hemocytes and slightly in heart but expression was negligible in hepatopancreas, intestine, stomach, and muscle. Immunoblotting revealed the localization to be in the large granules of hemocytes. Furthermore, L-cystatin has an antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, which is much stronger than that of chicken egg white cystatin. These data suggest that the large granule-derived L-cystatin serves synergistically to accomplish an effective defense against invading microbes, together with other defense molecules that are released in response to external stimuli.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021220,

(1993) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 114, 307-316). In the present work, lectin activity of this protein and its unique primary structure were elucidated. L10 was purified by four steps of chromatography, including dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B, CM-Sepharose CL-6B, Sephacryl S-200, and Mono S. At least three 27-kDa isoproteins, named L10a, L10b, and L10c, were isolated. Their amino acid compositions were almost indistinguishable, and there were no amino sugars. All the isoforms had hemagglutinating activity against human A-type erythrocytes, in a Ca(2+)-independent manner with L10b showing the highest activity. The L10b-mediated hemagglutination was inhibited in the presence of N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylallolactosamine, and the association constant (Ka) between L10b and N-acetylglucosamine was 1.95 x 10(4) M-1. Furthermore, L10b specifically agglutinated Staphylococcus saprophyticus KD. Ultracentrifugation analysis revealed that L10b is present in monomer form in solution. A cDNA coding for an isoform of L10 was isolated from a hemocyte cDNA library. The open reading frame of the 768-base pair cDNA coded for the signal sequence of 19 residues. The mature protein had 236 residues with the calculated molecular weight of 26,757. Amino acid sequences of the peptides derived from L10c exactly corresponded to the predicted sequence of the cDNA, whereas amino acid replacements of Ile-129 to Val and His-213 to Tyr existed both in L10a and L10b, suggesting that the cDNA codes for L10c.

Immunoreactivity was quantified in the opisthosomal nervous system (67.7 +/- 11.4 ng/g), cardiac ganglion (45.0 +/- 10.3 ng/g), prosomal nervous system (28.5 +/- 6.6 ng/g), and midgut (24.6 +/- 6.7 ng/g). In the brain, immunoreactive somata were observed in ganglion cells of the central body, in the medullary group and within the ventral medial group. Clusters of immunoreactive cells were found in each of the circumesophageal, pedal ganglia, and in the opisthosomal, abdominal ganglia. In the periphery, immunoreactive varicose fibers were observed in branches of the intestinal nerves, and near longitudinal and circular muscle fibers of the midgut. Immunoreactivity was observed in the cardiac ganglion and myocardium of the neurogenic heart. Synthetic crustacean cardioactive peptide had slight excitatory effects on the cardiac rhythm at doses up to 10(-6) M. This peptide had excitatory effects on the midgut at nanomolar doses. Ventral nerve cord extracts were partially purified with reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Two regions of immunoreactivity were detected, one of which coeluted with the authentic peptide. The distribution of crustacean cardioactive peptide immunoreactivity is compared with other transmitter systems in the Limulus nervous system, and myotropic actions of this peptide are discussed with respect to peptidergic modulation of intestinal motility.",10.1002/cne.903570105,
410,"Alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated clearance of proteases from the plasma of the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus.","R Melchior, J P Quigley, P B Armstrong",1995,"Because proteases free in the body are damaging to the tissues, animals have evolved various agents for their inactivation and clearance. Mammals, for instance, have a diverse array of active site protease inhibitors in the plasma. In addition, mammals have alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), which binds active proteases, and the alpha 2M-protease complex is then cleared from the plasma by a receptor-mediated endocytotic process. alpha 2M is also present in the plasma of many invertebrates, and in the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, it is the only protease inhibitor in the plasma. To search for a clearance process for proteases in Limulus, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled proteins were injected into the blood, and the fluorescence in the plasma and associated with the blood cells was determined. FITC-labeled trypsin was cleared with an initial mixing period (0-10 min) and a rapid clearance period (10-30 min), followed by the reappearance of FITC in the plasma (45-90 min). Before and during the clearance process, the labeled trypsin was associated with a complex having a molecular mass identical to that of Limulus alpha 2M, and that was precipitated by antibodies directed against Limulus alpha 2M. The fluoresceinated material that reappeared in the plasma after 45 min was of low molecular mass (< 10 kDa) and thus appears to have experienced degradation. The clearance of trypsin requires its protease activity, since phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-inactivated, FITC-labeled trypsin was cleared only very slowly if at all (t1/2 > 180 min). FITC-labeled, trypsin-reacted Limulus alpha 2M was cleared rapidly from the plasma of Limulus, whereas FITC-labeled, native Limulus alpha 2M persisted undiminished in excess of 400 min. The blood cells of Limulus bound FITC-labeled trypsin-reacted Limulus alpha 2M, and the peak of recovery from the blood cells coincided with the minimum concentration of FITC-labeled protein in the plasma, suggesting that the blood cells participate in the clearance of alpha 2M-protease complex from the plasma. Thus, we have demonstrated the existence of a clearance pathway in Limulus that operates selectively on enzymatically active proteases and have shown that Limulus alpha 2M is the probable agent for protease clearance. This is the first documentation of a protease clearance pathway in invertebrates and represents the first identified physicological function for alpha 2M in invertebrates.",10.1074/jbc.270.22.13496,

Tetrodotoxin (TTX) and its derivatives were major toxins in the toxic eggs of the horseshoe crab. An epidemic of poisoning by eating toxic eggs of the horseshoe crab affected 71 persons in Chon Buri which located in the eastern coast of Thailand. Patients generally presented with neurologic symptoms such as paresthesia, vertigo, weakness, respiratory paralysis, altered consciousness with unreactive dilated pupils in addition to gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Nineteen patients required artificial ventilation and there were two deaths. This is the first large outbreak of tetrodotoxin poisoning recognized in Thailand.",,

In our ongoing studies on granular components, we have identified here a novel defensin-like substance present in both L- and S-granules. This substance strongly inhibits the growth of Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, and fungi, such as Candida albicans. The isolated substance, tentatively termed ""big defensin,"" consists of 79 amino acid residues, of which the COOH-terminal 37 residues have a sequence similar to those of mammalian neutrophil-derived defensins, especially rat defensin. Characterization of the disulfide motif in big defensin indicated that the disulfide array is identical to that of beta-defensins from bovine neutrophils. One clear structural difference is that the limulus hemocyte-derived big defensin has an extension of the NH2-terminal hydrophobic sequence with 35 amino acid residues followed by the COOH-terminal cationic defensin portion. This amphipathic nature of big defensin seems likely to be associated with its potent antibacterial activity. Furthermore, antibacterial activities of the NH2-terminal hydrophobic region and the COOH-terminal defensin portion separated by tryptic digestion are significantly different: the former displays a more potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, whereas the latter is more potent against Gram-negative bacteria. Big defensin, therefore, may prove to represent a new class of defensin family possessing two functional domains with different antimicrobial activities.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124818,

CrFC26 includes 568 nucleotides of 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) containing seven ATGs before the real initiation site, an open reading frame (ORF) of 3249 nucleotides, a stop codon, and 365 nucleotides of 3' untranslated sequence. There are four polyadenylation signals and six potential glycosylation sites. The ORF codes for a signal peptide of 24 amino acids and a Factor C zymogen of 1059 residues. The CrFC21 lacks most of the 5' UTR, and has some base changes in its ORF. The predicted secondary mRNA structures of the 5' end of CrFC26 showed numerous stem-and-loop structures, thus obscuring its real start codon. In contrast, CrFC21 has a well-exposed AUG start site, and expresses Factor C in transcription-translation reactions in vitro. There is a typical serine protease catalytic triad of Asp-His-Ser, which is structurally like prothrombin, but catalytically more similar to trypsin. Although an overall homology of 97.7% was observed in comparison with the Tachypleus tridentatus Factor C (TtFC) cDNA, there were notable differences in the restriction sites and subtle base substitutions in the CrFC cDNA. The high degree of homology between Factor C from T. tridentatus and C. rotundicauda substantiates, at the molecular level, the proximity of these two species in the course of evolution. This finding contravenes the apparent disparities with respect to their morphology, ecological habitat, and taxonomical classification.",,

We have purified to homogeneity the serine protease zymogen factor G, which is directly activated by (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans and which initiates the hemolymph clotting cascade. Factor G is a heterodimeric protein composed of two noncovalently associated subunits alpha (72 kDa) and beta (37 kDa). In the presence of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans such as curdlan and paramylon, factor G is autocatalytically activated to an active serine protease named factor G. This activation is accompanied by limited proteolysis of both subunits: the 72-kDa subunit alpha is cleaved to 55-kDa and 17-kDa fragments, and the 37-kDa subunit beta is shortened to 34 kDa. Longer incubations with (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans result in cleavage of the 55-kDa fragment to 46 kDa and the 34-kDa fragment to 32 kDa, with concomitant loss of amidase activity. Reconstitution experiments using purified proteins participating in the hemolymph clotting cascade demonstrate that factor G is capable of activating proclotting enzyme directly, resulting in the conversion of coagulogen to coagulin gel. Thus, purified factor G is shown to be the primary initiator of the (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan-sensitive coagulation pathway in the horseshoe crab hemocyte lysate.",,

The protein, deduced from the arrestin cDNA, is most similar to arrestin from locust antennae (56% identity) and Drosophila phosrestin I (53% identity). Limulus arrestin was expressed in a heterologous system, and its properties were compared with those of a 46-kDa light-regulated phosphoprotein (pp46A) in Limulus photoreceptors described in previous studies from this laboratory. Arrestin and pp46A (a) have the same apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, (b) have an isoelectric point in the basic pH range, (c) require calmodulin and elevated Ca2+ levels for phosphorylation, (d) are immunoreactive with monoclonal antibody C10C10 directed against a sequence in bovine arrestin (S-antigen) that is perfectly conserved in the deduced arrestin protein, and (e) are associated with photoreceptors.

The elevation of the beach on which they nest differs among populations. We examined two factors that potentially affect egg survival at different beach elevations: erosion and rate of development. We found no evidence that eggs buried at different elevations incur different risks of erosion by wave action. However, the optimal beach elevation for egg development differed between our two study sites, Florida and Delaware, and the difference was related to beach morphology. Rate of development increased with oxygen concentration, redox potential, and temperature, and all three of these factors changed with elevation. The nests in the lower beach failed to develop, especially in Florida, where the beach was fine-grained and poorly drained. The nests in the upper beach were prone to dessication, especially in Delaware, where the beach was course-grained and well-drained. This means that differencces between sites in the optimal location for egg development coincided with horseshoe crab preferences in nestsite selection. We suggest that horseshoe crabs synchronize their nesting with the tides that reach the aerobic sediments on the beach, resulting in nesting patterns that differ with differences in tidal regimes and beach morphology.",10.2307/1542294,

While some studies of identified groups of central neurons have been conducted, little is known concerning the neuronal organization in Limulus central ganglia. This study was undertaken to determine the localization of serotoninergic neurons in the opisthosomal ventral nerve cord of Limulus and to construct a basis for further comparative biochemical and pharmacological studies of the specific function of these neurons. Endogenous serotonin was detected in the ventral nerve cord (chain of abdominal ganglia) by high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC). Endogenous serotonin was quantified in the 9th through 13th ganglia, anterior (hemal) nerves, posterior (branchial) nerves, and connectives. The serotonin content in the abdominal ganglia was significantly reduced when the ganglia were incubated for 24 hours in Leibovitz's (L-15) medium containing reserpine or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), neurotoxins that block the uptake of serotonin into storage vesicles. The distribution of serotonin-immunoreactive neurons in the ventral nerve cord was determined by indirect immunocytochemistry. Treatment of the chain of ganglia with an anti-serotonin antiserum followed by treatment with a fluorescent-labeled antiserum raised against the primary antibody demonstrated specific staining in each ganglion, the ganglionic roots, and connectives. Clusters of serotonin-immunoreactive neurons were observed anteriolaterally and posteriorly in each ganglion. Processes from dense fiber bundles extended from these clusters of neurons to the central region of each ganglion. These results demonstrate that serotonin-immunoreactive neurons are present in the opisthosomal ventral nerve cord of the horseshoe crab and that serotonin may function as a neurotransmitter.",10.1002/cne.903470212,

However, no fluorescence was observed when TTX was reacted with CFH at 37 degrees C. There was also an increase in the intensity of protein bands on SDS-PAGE gel corresponding to 26,000 and 28,000 mol. wts. This may be the result of the TTX-neutralization reaction in CFH. The pretreatment of TTX with CFH reduced the toxicity of TTX in mice by two-fold. The anti-TTX activity is temperature and time dependent as well as heat stable. Protein denaturation of the haemolymph suggests that proteinaceous factor(s) may also play a role in TTX-neutralizing activity of CFH. It is therefore possible that the detoxification system is attributed to concerted actions of both proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous factors in the haemolymph.",10.1016/0041-0101(94)90001-9,

SDS-PAGE revealed two apolipoproteins with masses similar to those of apolipophorins (apoLp-I, 265 +/- 14 kDa; apoLp-II, 89 +/- 6 kDa). Lipid composition was different from both insect lipophorin and crustacean HDL, and showed less diacylglycerols than triacylglycerols (3.8% and 36.2% of total lipids, respectively). Since Limulus polyphemus is closely related to precambrian chelicerates, our results confirm that lipophorin was present early in the evolution of arthropods.",,
427,"A lectin from the Asian horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus: purification, specificity and interaction with tumour cells.","E Fischer, N Q Khang, G Letendre, R Brossmer",1994,"A lectin from the haemolymph of the Asian horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B-bound N-acetylneuraminic acid. The specificity of this lectin was studied by haemagglutination inhibition with sialic acid analogues, N-acetylhexosamines and glycoproteins. For the interaction with the agglutinin the N-acetyl group and the glyceryl side chain of N-acetylneuraminic acid are important, while presence of an aglycon, specially an alpha-glycosidically linked lactose increases affinity to the lectin. The strongest glycoprotein inhibitors were ovine as well as bovine submaxillary mucin and Collocalia mucin, all being O-chain glycoproteins but carrying completely different carbohydrate chains. The majority of N-chain proteins were inactive. As the lectin agglutinates human erythrocytes, but not the murine lymphoma lines Eb and ESb or the human colon carcinoma HT 29, these cancer cells apparently lack the 'Tachypleus tridentatus agglutinin-receptor' which is present on red cells and O-chain glycoproteins.",10.1007/BF00732432,

A unique serine protease zymogen activated by cleavage of an Ile-Ile bond.,"T Muta, T Oda, S Iwanaga",1993,"Horseshoe crab factor B is an intracellular serine protease zymogen involved in the bacterial endotoxin-responsive hemolymph coagulation cascade. cDNAs for factor B were isolated utilizing a polymerase chain reaction product using two primers derived from the partial amino acid sequence. The cloned cDNA of 1928 base pairs encoded 400 amino acid residues of factor B precursor. The first 23 amino acid residues constitute a presumed prepropeptide that may be processed by both a signal peptidase and a processing protease, similar to mammalian vitamin K-dependent protease precursors. The mature protein consists of 377 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 40,570 Da. The overall structure is highly homologous to that of limulus proclotting enzyme (35.9% identity), the substrate for active factor B in the cascade. Like the proclotting enzyme, mature factor B is composed of an amino-terminal ""clip""-like domain and a carboxyl-terminal serine protease domain homologous to that of human plasma prekallikrein (36.5%). Internal sequences encode a unique activation peptide. Surprisingly, the cleavage sites of the zymogen factor B for activation by limulus active factor C were found to be an Arg-Ser and an Ile-Ile bond, the latter of which has not been found in any other protease zymogens. These cleavages result in the release of the activation peptide, which consists of 21 residues with a carboxyl-terminal isoleucine. These results indicate that the intracellular clotting system of the limulus hemocyte, like mammalian plasma clotting cascade, proceeds with the sequential activation of three serine protease zymogens: factor C, factor B, and proclotting enzyme.",,

On the other hand, the isolated S-granules contained antimicrobial tachyplesins I and II (17 amino acids in length) as the major component, in addition to 6 unidentified proteins with molecular masses of less than 30 kDa. The structural analyses of tachyplesin analogs indicated that all these peptides of mature form are stored in the S-granules, together with a processing intermediate containing the COOH-terminal Gly-Lys sequence. We also found an Arg-rich protein of 22 kDa and a Leu-rich protein of 30 kDa in S-granules. Based on these observations, we speculate that protein components in L-granules, which probably contain all the factors essential for the limulus clotting system, participate in immobilization of invading microbes and that factors in the S-granules containing tachyplesins contribute to a self-defense system against invaders.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124173,

Molecules that bind LPS and neutralize its biological effects or enhance its clearance could have important clinical applications. Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) binds LPS tightly, and, in animal models, reduces mortality when administered before or after LPS challenge or bacterial infection. Here we present the high resolution structure of a recombinant LALF. It has a single domain consisting of three alpha-helices packed against a four-stranded beta-sheet. The wedge-shaped molecule has a striking charge distribution and amphipathicity that suggest how it can insert into membranes. The binding site for LPS probably involves an extended amphipathic loop, and we propose that two mammalian LPS-binding proteins will have a similar loop. The amphipathic loop structure may be used in the design of molecules with therapeutic properties against septic shock.",10.1002/j.1460-2075.1993.tb06008.x,

The retina of the compound lateral eye of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, was dissociated into individual retinular cells using an enzyme pretreatment consisting of collagenase, papain, and trypsin, and a two-stage mechanical dissociation. These photoreceptors are functionally viable in an organ culture medium for up to 1 week and possess naked arhabdomeral and rhabdomeral segment membranes which are easily accessible for whole-cell recordings. A dissection technique was also developed whereby the retinal epidermis and neural plexus, as well as the second-order eccentric cells, could be separated from the ommatidia of the compound lateral eye in one simple step, providing viable isolated ommatidia attached to the cornea. The enzyme pretreatment used for dissociating the retina was then used to remove the individual ommatidia from the corneal cones. Hoffman modulation contrast microscopy was used to develop a reliable method for sorting and collecting viable isolated retinular cells for morphological and electrophysiological studies. Morphological analysis using light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that isolated retinular cells are morphologically nearly identical to retinular cells in situ. Isolated retinular cells possess a normal rhabdomere with no apparent loss of microvillar membrane as a result of the isolation process. Ommatidia can presently be isolated with up to six retinular cells possessing essentially normal structure and ultrastructure including thick rays of rhabdom.

The opsin cDNAs obtained from the lateral eye and ocellar libraries code for deduced proteins with 376 amino acids. The two cDNAs are 96% identical at the nucleic acid level, differing primarily at the 3' untranslated region, and are apparently the products of two separate genes. The deduced opsin proteins are 99% identical to each other, differing at only 5 amino acids. The opsins encoded by these cDNAs are most likely the protein moiety of the visible-wavelength rhodopsins in this animal. In the lateral eye, expression of the opsin gene is restricted to the photoreceptor cells of the ommatidia. Comparisons with opsins of other species show that the Limulus opsin proteins are most similar (53% identity) to the opsin from the R1-6 photoreceptors of flies.",10.1073/pnas.90.13.6150,

The cells were maintained in a culture medium and tested for function using whole-cell and cell-attached patch configurations of the gigaseal technique. The cells dissociated from the eye generated spontaneous voltage and current bumps in the dark, and depolarized in a graded fashion to increasing intensities of light over several decades, producing responses similar to those of cells in vivo. Currents evoked during voltage clamp were similar to those in ventral photoreceptor cells of Limulus, although transient currents in the dark- and light-activated currents were smaller in isolated lateral eye cells, perhaps because of the slow speed and spatial nonuniformity of the clamp in these large cells. In addition to isolated cells, dissociation of the compound eye produced small clusters of cells and isolated ommatidia which were also tested for function. Comparison of the electrical characteristics of isolated cells with those of cells in small clusters and in their ommatidial matrix suggests that the electrical junctions normally connecting photoreceptor cells within an ommatidium are functional in the latter groups, but not in isolated cells. Cell-attached patches of rhabdomeral membrane of isolated cells contained light-activated channels, resembling those observed in ventral photoreceptor cells, but no voltage-activated channels. Similar patches of arhabdomeral membrane contained voltage-activated channels, but no light-activated channels. We conclude that this preparation is suitable for studies of processes involved in generating the light response in invertebrate photoreceptor cells.",10.1017/s0952523800005319,

Ultrastructural and biochemical analyses indicate that the eggshells consist of primary inner and secondary outer layers. Protein of the primary layer is rich in glycine, aspartate/asparagine, serine, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa). In this regard it resembles the eggshell compositions of other members of the phylum Platyhelminthes. The primary layer appears to be derived from precursors produced in the vitelline cells of the flatworm. Each egg-laying episode consumes all of the precursor-containing vitelline cells. A Dopa-containing protein, vitelline protein 1 (Vp1), has been isolated from B. candida and resembles the primary eggshell layer in its composition. Vp1 has an apparent molecular weight of 34.4 and an acidic pI. Dopa-containing proteins are presumed to be directly involved in the cross-linking reactions that accompany quinone-tanning. The secondary outer layer of the eggshell may serve to adhere the eggshell to the gill.

When the binding sites of these mAbs were analyzed by immunoblotting, ten mAbs recognized nonreduced factor C, five mAbs were directed against the heavy chain, and two mAbs were directed against the B chain. Three mAbs, 1H4, 2C12, and 2A7, one selected from each group, were used for further study. The mAb 1H4, which recognized only nonreduced factor C molecule, inhibited the factor C activity in a dose-dependent manner. It also inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and alpha-chymotrypsin-mediated activations of the zymogen factor C, suggesting that 1H4 binds close to the active site and/or the substrate-binding site located in the serine protease domain (B chain) of factor C. On the other hand, 2C12 and 2A7 recognized, respectively, an epitope located in the heavy and the B chains, and inhibited LPS-mediated activation of factor C, but not alpha-chymotrypsin-mediated activation of factor C or factor C activity. Both F(ab')2 and Fab' fragments derived from 2C12 inhibited LPS-mediated activation in the same manner. These three mAbs did not bind with LPS, although a factor C-mAb complex was able to bind LPS, suggesting that the LPS-mediated activation of the zymogen factor C was induced through intermolecular interaction between the LPS-bound factor C molecules. The dissociation constants (Kd) for 1H4, 2C12, and 2A7 binding to factor C were determined as 1.9 x 10(-9), 0.6 x 10(-10), and 1.8 x 10(-10) M, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a123924,

Tachyplesin I inhibited bacterial growth irreversibly within 40 min. A subinhibitory concentration of tachyplesin I sensitized gram-negative bacteria to the bactericidal actions of novobiocin and nalidixic acid, although polymyxin B-resistant strains which have altered lipopolysaccharides were susceptible to tachyplesin I. This implies that tachyplesin permeabilizes the outer membrane and that the likely target of its action is outer membrane constituents other than lipopolysaccharides. On the other hand, a defensin-susceptible phoP strain of Salmonella typhimurium was also susceptible to tachyplesin I. Tachyplesin I rapidly depolarized the inverted inner-membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli. These results suggest that depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane, preceded by the permeabilization of the outer membrane for gram-negative bacteria, is associated with tachyplesin-mediated bactericidal activity.

Unreacted Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin had a subunit molecular mass of 185 kDa. Trypsin-reacted samples contained two prominent peptides smaller (85 and 100 kDa) and three peptides larger (200, 250, and 300-350 kDa) than the unreacted subunit. Reaction of methylamine-treated Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin with trypsin resulted in the same two prominent reaction products smaller than 185 kDa, but all of the reaction products larger than 185 kDa were absent. The covalent binding of biotinylated trypsin with Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin was detected by probing Western blots with horseradish peroxidase-avidin. Surprisingly, the only reaction products that contained trypsin were bands at 100 and 120 kDa. The staining of these bands with horseradish peroxidase-avidin was weak: most of the biotinylated trypsin that remained associated with alpha 2-macroglobulin during gel filtration chromatography was located at the dye front following reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The reaction products larger than 185 kDa did not contain trypsin. Methylamine-reacted Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin failed to bind any biotinylated trypsin. In contrast to the reaction of trypsin with Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin, all high molecular mass bands generated by the reaction of human alpha 2-macroglobulin with biotinylated trypsin stained intensely with horseradish peroxidase-avidin. Thus, Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin forms thiol ester-dependent, high molecular mass products involving isopeptide bonding between trypsin-generated fragments, without the incorporation of trypsin into the complexes.

Limulus trypsin inhibitor (LTI) was separated from coagulogen by ion-exchange chromatography on carboxymethyl-Sephadex. LTI is an inhibitor of trypsin (Ki = 3.3 nM) on both high and low molecular weight substrates. It also inhibits chymotrypsin but has little or no effect on thrombin, thermolysin, pepsin, or papain, nor does LTI inhibit the proteolytic cascade produced in endotoxin-stimulated Limulus amoebocyte lysate coagulation. Electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions on denaturing polyacrylamide gel yields a doublet migrating with an estimated Mr of 20,000. Under reducing conditions, a single broad band migrates with an estimated Mr of 15,000. The native structure is a monomer of moderate asymmetry with a molecular weight of 16,300 and a so20,w = 1.5(5), as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation. The amino acid composition of LTI yields a calculated molecular weight of 15,680 and a calculated partial specific volume of 0.71(7) ml/g.

The posterior third of the circumoesophageal ring and the abdominal ganglia contain a far larger number of NSCs compared to the anterior part of the CNS. The ability of NSC groups to form numerous axon bundles, decussation of the neurosecretory axons, the presence of a rich capillary network round neurosecretory perikaryons and the appearance of atypical neurons in the anteromedian part of the CNS are further striking features discussed with reference to the neurosecretory phylogeny of the species in question.",,

Influenza A (H1N1) virus was slightly inactivated by tachyplesin I, whereas herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, adenovirus 1, reovirus 2 and poliovirus 1 were resistant to inactivation. The inactivation of VSV by tachyplesin I depended on the concentration, the time and the temperature of incubation. Pretreatment of tachyplesin I with trypsin or lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacteria entirely abolished the antiviral activity. Electron microscopy of VSV treated with tachyplesin I showed naked and damaged virions.

The cleavage site that accompanies activation catalyzed by trypsin-like active factor B, proved to be an Arg-Ile bond. The resulting carboxyl-terminal heavy chain is composed of a typical serine protease domain, with a sequence similar to that of human coagulation factor XIa (34.5%) or factor Xa (34.1%). The light chain has a unique disulfide-knotted domain which shows no significant homology with any other known proteins.

We report here the entire cDNA sequence coding for the tachyplesin precursors and their distribution in various tissues of the horseshoe crab. Sequence analysis of the cloned cDNAs revealed that the tachyplesin precursors consist of 77 amino acids with 23 residues in a presegment, and that there are two types of mRNAs corresponding to the isopeptides tachyplesins I and II. Both precursors contain a putative signal peptide, a processing peptide sequence and a carboxyl-terminal amidation signal ""Gly-Lys-Arg"" connected to the mature tachyplesin peptide. Moreover, an unusual acidic amino acid cluster, Asp-Glu-Asp-Glu-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-COOH, is present in the carboxyl-terminal portions of both precursors. These results suggest that the two types of tachyplesin precursors are first synthesized as preproproteins and are then incorporated into the intracellular organelle, accompanied by various processing events. Northern blot analysis on a total RNA from various tissues of the horseshoe crab revealed that the tachyplesin precursors are expressed mainly in hemocytes and cardiac and brain tissues.

Tachyplesin I takes on a fairly rigid conformation constrained by two disulfide bridges and adopts a conformation consisting of an anti-parallel beta-sheet (residues 3-8 and 11-16) connected by a beta-turn (residues 8-11). In this planar conformation, five bulky hydrophobic side groups are localized in one side of the plane and six cationic side groups are distributed at the ""tail"" part of the molecule (residues 1-5 and 14-17).

452,"Involvement of cyclic AMP in multiple, excitatory actions of biogenic amines on the cardiac ganglion of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus.","J R Groome, W H Watson",1990,"Cyclic AMP appears to be involved in several excitatory actions of amines on neurones of the Limulus cardiac ganglion. Amines selectively increase levels of cardiac ganglion cyclic AMP with a magnitude and time course similar to that observed for amine-induced excitation of cardiac ganglion burst rate. With respect to either the physiological or biochemical effect, the apparent order of potency is octopamine greater than epinephrine approximately dopamine greater than norepinephrine. Elevation of cardiac ganglion cyclic AMP levels by octopamine or dopamine is dose-dependent and is potentiated by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl 1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Several pharmacological agents which influence cyclic nucleotide metabolism, including forskolin, IBMX and 8-substituted cyclic AMP analogues, have amine-like effects on the Limulus cardiac ganglion. These effects include increased burst rate of the isolated cardiac ganglion and decreased burst duration, interburst interval and number of spikes per burst in follower neurones. Forskolin and IBMX increase levels of cardiac ganglion cyclic AMP, and IBMX also increases cyclic GMP levels in this tissue. Amines, forskolin and IBMX have direct effects on follower neurones pharmacologically isolated from pacemaker cell input. Octopamine, forskolin and IBMX depolarize follower neurones, while dopamine hyperpolarizes these cells. Amines, forskolin and IBMX elicit burst-like potentials in follower neurones, and increase the size of evoked, unitary junction potentials recorded in cardiac muscle fibres. These pharmacological and biochemical data suggest that multiple, excitatory effects of biogenic amines on the Limulus cardiac ganglion are mediated by simultaneous increases in cyclic AMP at several loci within this neural network.",10.1242/jeb.152.1.313,

Two morphologically distinct, ellipsoidal, and mononucleate hemocytes--granulocytes (amebocytes) and plasmatocytes--are revealed. Granulocytes constitute about 97% of the hemocytes. They have a marginal band of microtubules, a heterochromatic nucleus, distended but poorly developed RER, few free ribosomes, few mitochondria, and many large secretory granules. The majority of these granules have a uniform content and are mature. Structured granules located in the proximity of Golgi complexes may be immature transitional stages leading to the mature uniform granules. Upon stimulation with endotoxin from gram negative bacteria, the mature granules become transitory structured before exocytosis. In contrast, the immature granules are not exocytosed. Plasmatocytes constitute about 3% of the hemocytes. They differ from granulocytes by having an euchromatic nucleus, a well-developed RER of flattened or tubular cisternae, many free ribosomes, many mitochondria, but only few, if any, large secretory granules.

In our continuing studies on the peptide, we have found an isopeptide, tachyplesin II, and also polyphemusins I and II in hemocytes of the American horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus). The complete primary structures of these peptides, which are very similar to that of the previously isolated peptide, now named tachyplesin I, were determined to be as follows: (Table: see text). The isopeptide, tachyplesin II, consists of 17 residues with a COOH-terminal arginine alpha-amide. On the other hand, both polyphemusins I and II were found to contain 18 residues due to an additional Arg residue at the NH2-terminal end as well as a COOH-terminal arginine alpha-amide. The disulfide linkages for polyphemusin I consisted of two bridges between Cys-4 and Cys-17 and between Cys-8 and Cys-13, which was identical to in the case of tachyplesin I. Moreover, all of these peptides inhibited the growth of not only Gram-negative and -positive bacteria but also fungi, such as Candida albicans M9. Furthermore, complex formation between these peptides and bacterial lipopolysaccharides was also observed in a double diffusion test. These results suggest that tachyplesins and polyphemusins are probably located in the hemocyte membrane, where they act on antimicrobial peptides as a self-defense mechanism in the horseshoe crab against invading microorganisms.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a122913,

The optimal conditions of in vitro cultivation of amebocytes were incubation at 15 degrees C and pH delta 6.8-7.2. The best medium was the hemolymph of the horseshoe crab. Measuring DNA synthesis of amebocytes by 3H-thymidine uptake showed that no proliferation of amebocytes occurs during in vitro cultivation.

460,Second-messenger systems underlying amine and peptide actions on cardiac muscle in the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus.,"J R Groome, W H Watson",1989,"The biochemical mechanisms by which octopamine, catecholamines and the peptide proctolin exert their actions on Limulus cardiac muscle were investigated. Amines produced long-lasting increases in the amplitude of contractions evoked by electrical stimulation. At 10(-5) mol l-1, the apparent order of potency for amine-induced increases in evoked contraction amplitude was dopamine approximately equal to octopamine greater than norepinephrine approximately equal to epinephrine. At this dose, amines produced long-lasting increases in the levels of cyclic AMP (octopamine greater than dopamine approximately equal to norepinephrine approximately equal to epinephrine), but not of cyclic GMP, in Limulus cardiac muscle. Like the amines, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin enhanced cardiac muscle contractility and increased levels of cyclic AMP, but not of cyclic GMP. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX produced a transient increase in cardiac muscle contractility, but typically produced long-lasting negative inotropy. This agent increased levels of both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in Limulus cardiac muscle. Proctolin and the protein kinase C activator phorbol dB increased the contraction amplitude of the intact heart and the electrically stimulated myocardium. These compounds, as well as dopamine, elicited sustained contractures and rhythmic contractions when applied to deganglionated Limulus cardiac muscle rings. Unlike the amines, proctolin and phorbol dB did not increase cardiac muscle cyclic AMP levels. These results suggest that several second-messenger systems may be utilized by amines and peptides to produce excitatory actions on cardiac muscle fibers of the Limulus heart. Cyclic AMP appears to be an important second messenger underlying the effects of amines to enhance cardiac muscle contractility. Pharmacological data suggest that proctolin may alter cardiac muscle contractility and excitability by a mechanism which involves the phosphatidylinositol pathway. Dopamine, unlike the other amines, produces a number of proctolin-like effects and may activate both the cyclic AMP and the phosphatidylinositol systems in Limulus cardiac muscle.",10.1242/jeb.145.1.419,

In this study, we examine the ability of anti-LPS factor purified from T. tridentatus to inhibit the activation of cultured human endothelial cells by LPS. Anti-LPS factor inhibited the stimulation of endothelial adhesiveness for neutrophils by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Maximum inhibition was achieved when anti-LPS factor was mixed with LPS prior to addition to the endothelial cell monolayers.

These results suggest that the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase system may play an important role in endotoxin-induced gel formation, and it was concluded that, in the presence of both Ca++ and endotoxin, the calmodulin-like protein will activate the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase system and decrease the concentration of cyclic AMP, thus promoting gel formation.",,

The competitive inhibition of various LPS, lipid A, anti-LPS factor, or polymyxin B to factor C binding indicates that the immunohistochemical reaction is specific to LPS. Investigating the time course of LPS distribution during 6 hr after IV injection of 5 mg/kg to rats, the greatest uptake of LPS was evident in the reticuloendothelial system (RES), particularly in Kupffer cells, 5 min after injection, and in adrenocortical cells 3 hr after the injection. Shortly after the injection, LPS also appeared in platelet thrombi, intravascular monocytes, and a few neutrophils, and on the surface of endothelial cells in liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and aorta.

The subsequent study of this zymogen, using various synthetic lipid A analogues, revealed that the zymogen factor C is rapidly activated by acylated (beta 1-6)-D-glucosamine disaccharide bisphosphate (synthetic Escherichia coli-type lipid A), and the corresponding 4'-monophosphate analogues. However, the corresponding non-phosphorylated lipid A did not activate factor C, indicating that a phosphate ester group linked with the (beta 1-6)-D-glucosamine disaccharide backbone is required for the zymogen activation. During these studies we also found that the zymogen factor C is significantly activated by acidic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, but not at all by neutral phospholipids. The rate of this activation, however, was affected markedly by ionic strength in the reaction mixture, although such an effect was not observed in the lipid-A-mediated activation of factor C. A variety of negatively charged surfaces, such as sulfatide, dextran sulfate and ellagic acid, which are known as typical initiators for activation of the mammalian intrinsic clotting system, did not show any effect on the zymogen factor C activation.

Regarding Limulus activity, a newly developed colorimetric method, which utilizes a mixture of recombined clotting factors and a chromogenic substance, was much more sensitive for detecting changes in the chemical structure of test compounds than the conventional gelation method using the amoebocyte whole lysate. (beta 1-6)-D-Glucosamine disaccharide bisphosphates, which had neither 3-hydroxyacyl nor 3-acyloxyacyl groups, and acylglucosamine phosphates, which in structure correspond or are analogous to the non-reducing or reducing moieties of lipids A and biosynthetic disaccharide lipid A precursors showed only negligible activity in the colorimetric tests, but they exhibited a distinct though much weaker gelation activity than the parent disaccharide molecules. The assay results obtained by the colorimetric Limulus test correlate better with the pyrogenicity of the test synthetic compounds than those given by the gelation method, although the dependence of pyrogenicity on chemical structure is greater. The presence of 3-hydroxyacyl groups on the bisphosphorylated (beta 1-6)-D-glucosamine disaccharide backbone is the prerequisite for effective activation of the clotting enzyme cascade of horseshoe crab amoebocyte lysate, while the presence of an adequate number (one or two) of 3-acyloxyacyl groups on the disaccharide bisphosphate backbone is needed for full pyrogenicity. Complement activation, on the other hand, showed structural requirements quite different from those for the colorimetric Limulus activity and the pyrogenicity. The disaccharide compounds that had only non-hydroxylated acyl groups, acylated glucosamine phosphates that had the structure of the non-reducing portion of lipids A and biosynthetic disaccharide precursors, which were scarcely active in the colorimetric Limulus test, caused complement activation comparable to or sometimes stronger than that of the parent disaccharide molecules.

The molecular mass of the purified protein was estimated to be 282,000 +/- 10,000 Da by gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation. SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the protein is composed of ten subunits having a molecular mass of 28,000 +/- 2,000 Da.

The extracts and glucans activate the lysate enzyme compound G, which in turn activates clotting enzyme. Activated clotting enzyme causes a positive CS-TAL reaction. C. albicans extracts and glucans react positively with a commercially available, unaltered CS-TAL preparation (Toxicolor), but they give a negative reaction with a CS-TAL from which compound G has been excluded (Endospecy). An autoclaved, sterile preparation of Sabouraud glucose broth used as a control in one experiment gave (like Candida extracts) a positive reaction with Toxicolor and a negative reaction with Endospecy. We found that the peptone powder used to make the Sabouraud glucose broth was contaminated with a strain of Bacillus subtilis. Autoclaved aqueous extracts of culture-grown B. subtilis cells were positive with Toxicolor and negative with Endospecy. This was also the case with two other strains of B. subtilis. Polysaccharides obtained from these extracts gave the same result. Endotoxin activates clotting enzyme through activation of the lysate enzyme compound C, which is present in both Toxicolor and Endospecy. Endotoxin, therefore, reacts with both CS-TAL preparations. Simultaneous assay with Toxicolor and Endospecy distinguishes endotoxin from fungal products, but since products of fungi and B. subtilis both give a positive Toxicolor and a negative Endospecy test, a simultaneous assay cannot differentiate them. However, this does not decrease the clinical value of the simultaneous Toxicolor-Endospecy assay for distinguishing fungal infection from endotoxemia because B. subtilis so rarely causes disease that it can be excluded from clinical consideration.",10.1128/jcm.26.5.890-892.1988,

This complex formation was also confirmed by double diffusion analysis on agarose plates. Triton X-100, which destroys LPS micelles, strongly inhibited the LPS-mediated activation of factor C but not activated factor C. These results indicate that the binding of factor C with LPS is required for its activation and that only LPS-associated factor C generates the active factor C. On the other hand, the LPS-mediated activation of factor C was strongly inhibited by the S-alkylated heavy chain derived from factor C.

In humans, this mechanism occasionally subverts its presumed protective function by overresponding in a manner that results in pathophysiologic thrombosis or hemorrhage. (In this regard, it is interesting that human platelets are much more resistant to the effects of bacterial endotoxins than are other species.) Similarly, the rudimentary ability of mammalian platelets to phagocytose particles and kill bacteria may be another remnant of functions that are more important in amebocytes (or the thrombocytes of other invertebrates). Thus, these two cells, one from an ancient invertebrate and the other from mammals, have remarkably similar characteristics, although the relative importance of their various functions has changed as evolution has taken place.

It is a two-chain glycoprotein (Mr = 123,000) composed of a heavy chain (Mr = 80,000) and a light chain (Mr = 43,000) [T. Nakamura et al. (1986) Eur. J. Biochem. 154, 511-521]. In our continued study of this zymogen, we have now also found a single-chain form of factor C (Mr = 123,000) in the hemocyte lysate. The heavy chain had the NH2-terminal sequence of Ser-Gly-Val-Asp-, consistent with that of the single-chain factor C, indicating that the heavy chain is derived from the NH2-terminal part of the molecule. The light chain had an NH2-terminal sequence of Ser-Ser-Gln-Pro-. Incubation of the two-chain zymogen with lipopolysaccharide resulted in the cleavage of a Phe-Ile bond between residues 72 and 73 of the light chain. Concomitant with this cleavage, the A (72 amino acid residues) and B chains derived from the light chain were formed. The complete amino acid sequence of the A chain was determined by automated Edman degradation. The A chain contained a typical segment which is similar in sequence to a family of repeats in human beta 2-glycoprotein I, complement factors B, protein H, C4b-binding protein, and coagulation factor XIII b subunit. The NH2-terminal sequence of the B chain was Ile-Trp-Asn-Gly-. This chain contained the serine-active site sequence-Asp-Ala-Cys-Ser-Gly-Asp-Ser-Gly-Gly-Pro-. These results indicate that horseshoe crab factor C exists in the hemocytes in a single-chain zymogen form and is converted to an active serine protease by hydrolysis of a specific Phe-Ile peptide bond.",10.1111/j.1432-1033.1987.tb13352.x,
475,"Reaction of fungal products with amebocyte lysates of the Japanese horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus.","D S Hodes, D Heon, A Hass, A C Hyatt, H L Hodes",1987,"A commercially available endotoxin assay (CS-TAL) employing a chromogenic peptide and an amebocyte lysate from the Japanese horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus, gave a positive result with aqueous extracts of all 15 strains of Candida albicans and 1 strain each of Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and a Mucor species that we tested. Purified glucans prepared from the Candida strains gave the same results. Reconstruction experiments showed that the positive results were not due to contaminating endotoxin. By contrast, assays employing amebocyte lysates of the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, were inconsistent. Japanese workers have presented evidence that glucans activate the Tachypleus amebocyte lysate system by acting on an enzyme different from that on which endotoxin acts. Using a Tachypleus lysate preparation (Endospecy; Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) from which this enzyme was excluded, we demonstrated a 5- to 10-fold drop in reactivity to the aqueous Candida extracts and glucans, whereas reactivity to endotoxin was unchanged. Normal human plasma was shown to decrease the effect of fungal extracts on CS-TAL. This inhibition was completely removed by heating the plasma. Our results suggest that Tachypleus systems may be of use clinically in distinguishing bacterial from fungal infections.",10.1128/jcm.25.9.1701-1704.1987,

Upon sequencing the peptides by the automated Edman method, the following primary structure was obtained: (Sequence: in text). During the sequence analysis, two species of the protein, which differed from each other at one locus, were found and characterized. L. polyphemus anti-LPS factor was a basic protein consisting of a single polypeptide chain of 101 residues and a calculated molecular weight of 11,786 or 11,800. The hydrophobic NH2-terminal sequence and the clustering of positive charges found in the disulfide loop yielded a typical amphipathic character of this protein. Moreover, L. polyphemus anti-LPS factor showed 83% sequence identity with the Tachypleus tridentatus protein, and the sequence similar to that observed in the EF-hand structure was found to contain in the COOH terminal portions of these proteins, although its function is unknown.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a121999,

It consisted of a single polypeptide with a total of 61 amino acid residues. This protease inhibitor inhibited stoichiometrically the amidase activity of trypsin (Ki = 4.60 X 10(-10) M), and also had inhibitory effects on alpha-chymotrypsin (Ki = 5.54 X 10(-9) M), elastase (Ki = 7.20 X 10(-8) M), plasmin, and plasma kallikrein. However, it had no effect on T. tridentatus clotting enzyme and factor C, mammalian blood coagulation factors (activated protein C, factor Xa and alpha-thrombin), papain, and thermolysin. The complete amino acid sequence of this inhibitor was determined and its sequence was compared with those of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and other Kunitz-type inhibitors. It was found that the amino acid sequence of this inhibitor has a high homology of 47 and 43% with those of sea anemone inhibitor 5-II and BPTI, respectively.

The data suggest the following: 1. The primordia of segments are formed one by one from the cells at the posterior end of the embryonic area, and they are determined soon after formation. 2. When DNA synthesis inhibitors are applied, the forming primordium acquires a character intermediate between the anterior segment already determined and the segment next to be determined. 3. The abnormal differentiation is possibly caused by a time lag between DNA synthesis and the rest of metabolism. 4. The specific character of each segment of normal embryos and malformations successively determines that of the next segment. 5.

Clones carrying cDNA fragments for coagulogen were isolated from a cDNA library of the hemocyte mRNA using synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides as probes. The nucleotide sequence analyses of the cloned cDNAs revealed that the hemocyte coagulogen consists of 175 amino acids with 20 amino acids in a presegment, and that there are two types of mRNAs for coagulogen. The two mRNAs exhibited three nucleotide substitutions, two of which were in their protein-coding regions, resulting in two amino acid replacements. Subsequently, two molecular species of coagulogen, named coagulogens type I and type II, were identified by tryptic peptide mapping of the mature proteins isolated from the hemocyte lysate. These results suggest that the two types of coagulogens are first synthesized as preproteins and are incorporated into the granules that are abundantly present in the hemocytes with liberation of the signal peptides.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a121696,

Electron microscopic and optical diffraction studies indicated that both the helical structures and the interfilament spacing of the actin filaments composing the acrosomal bundle were indistinguishable among the four species. These results suggest that the MW 95,000 protein crosslinks actin filaments in the bundle.

MtDNA clonal diversity was moderately high, particularly in southern samples, and a major genetic ""break"" (nucleotide sequence divergence approximately 2%) distinguished all sampled individuals which were north vs. south of a region in northeastern Florida. The area of genotypic divergence in Limulus corresponds to a long-recognized zoogeographic boundary between warm-temperate and tropical marine faunas, and it suggests that selection pressures and/or gene flow barriers associated with water mass differences may also influence the evolution of species widely distributed across such transition zones. On the other hand, a comparison of the mtDNA divergence patterns in Limulus with computer models involving stochastic lineage extinction in species with limited gene flow demonstrates that deterministic explanations need not necessarily be invoked to account for the observations. Experiments to distinguish stochastic from deterministic possibilities are suggested. Overall, the pattern and magnitude of mtDNA differentiation in horseshoe crabs is very similar to that typically reported for freshwater and terrestrial species assayed over a comparable geographic range. Results demonstrate for the first time that, geographically, at least some continuously distributed marine organisms can show considerable mtDNA genetic differentiation.",10.1093/genetics/112.3.613,

The factor B, which was produced separately by treating the partially purified factor B with factor C, was also purified. It gave a single band on unreduced SDS-PAGE and two bands on reduced SDS-PAGE. The purified factor B had Mr of 56,000 consisting of a heavy chain (Mr = 32,000) and a light chain (Mr = 25,000). These results indicated that the purified factor B zymogen is a mixture of single-chain and two-chain forms, both of which have the same molecular weight of 64,000, and that these two forms are converted to factor B by factor C. The diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate-sensitive site of factor B was found in the heavy chain. The reconstitution studies using purified factor C, factor B, proclotting enzyme and coagulogen in the presence of lipopolysaccharide indicated that factor B is an essential component to complete sequential activation of the limulus clotting system, and that it specifically activates proclotting enzyme to the active clotting enzyme.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a135545,

It is unclear whether the conversion of skin reactivity by DLE is due to a donor-related specific transfer factor or to an antigen nonspecific augmenting factor which enhances a preexisting low-level response in DLE recipients. In this study, DLE from immunized and unimmunized human and calf donors or saline was administered to 88 medical students. The recipient population demonstrated minimal background responses to the test antigens keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) and horseshoe crab haemocyanin (HCH). The results indicate that the DLE preparations from both immunized and unimmunized donors significantly stimulated skin reactivity but not in vitro responses to both KLH and HCH in the recipient population.

The inhibitor is sensitive to mild acidification, methylamine treatment, and inhibits the proteolytic activity of a variety of endopeptidases. The molecule does not inhibit trypsin-mediated hydrolysis of low molecular weight substrates and protects the active site of trypsin from inactivation by soybean trypsin inhibitor. These properties are diagnostic of the alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) class of protease inhibitors found in vertebrates. Like vertebrate alpha 2M the Limulus alpha 2M molecule is composed of subunits of molecular weight 180,000-185,000 as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The apparent native molecular weight for the Limulus molecule as determined by both gel filtration and gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions is 500,000-550,000, compared to a native molecular weight of 700,000-750,000 for human alpha 2M, determined in parallel under identical conditions.

Its haemagglutinin activity was inhibited by purified lysate, coagulogen, but not by sugars. The haemagglutinin differed immunologically and in activity from the sialic-acid-binding lectin carcinoscorpin present in the haemolymph. It caused aggregation of forma-fixed amoebocytes, and on the basis of this observation its role in cell-cell adhesion is proposed. This new haemagglutinin promotes cell-cell aggregation in amoebocytes in a manner that shares some similarities with thrombospondin-mediated platelet aggregation in vertebrates [Jaffe, Leuang, Nachman, Levin & Moseher (1981) Nature (London) 295, 246-248].",10.1042/bj2300321,

This one microglomerulus contains the axons of 19 retinular cells, which pass by without contacts; 13 efferent fibres with 44 synapses to and from eccentric cell collaterals; and arborizations from 54 eccentric cells with 577 synapses. Eccentric cell axons are devoid of synaptic input. Their collaterals ramify in synaptic knots and subserve both pre- and postsynaptic functions simultaneously. Arborizations near the axon of origin have a highly branched pattern (up to 20 bifurcations), a high synaptic input: output ratio (up to about 9:1), and high synaptic density (a maximum of 12 per micrometre of neurite length). The opposite extreme is represented by sparsely branched eccentric cell collaterals distant from their axons of origin with very little synaptic input and sparse output. Spatially graded lateral inhibition is the apparent outcome of a radially decreasing distribution of inhibitory synapses on the arborizations of eccentric cell collaterals combined with possible decremental signal transmission in the plexus. The synaptic analysis has a bearing on most physiological aspects of lateral inhibition that have been studied in the Limulus eye. Implied in the results is the suggestion that synapse formation is an intrinsic property of the presynaptic element, but that the connectivity is governed by the electrical activity of target neurons.",10.1098/rspb.1985.0060,

The proteins thus obtained were designated as ABS-I, -II, and -III in the order of elution and have apparent molecular weights of 25,000 (ABS-II) and 10,000 (ABS-III) as judged by both gel-filtration on Fractogel TSK (Toyopearl) HW-60 in 10 M urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis; the molecular weight of ABS-I could not be estimated in the two systems since it was too high. ABS-I, -II, and -III, of which only ABS-I is water-soluble, inhibit one hemagglutination unit of activity with minimum quantities of 0.5 micrograms/ml, 7.8 micrograms/ml, and 1.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. They were found to be glycoproteins in which 6.6% of the dry weight (ABS-I), 4.2% of the dry weight (ABS-II), and 7.5% of the dry weight (ABS-III) were carbohydrate. The dry weight ratio of hexosamines in these substances is 3:1:2 (ABS-I: ABS-II: ABS-III), and that of sialic acid is also 3:1:2. Amino acid analyses of these proteins indicated that they have high contents of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and glycine in common.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a134878,

The specific activity of the purified protein was increased about 1,300 times in comparison with that of the starting material. The active protein was present in highly polymerized forms which were multimers of an identical subunit with a molecular weight of approximately 40,000 as measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This agglutinin was shown to have multimeric activity towards different kinds of erythrocytes and its hemagglutinating activity was inhibited by N-acetylamino sugars and bovine submaxillary gland mucin containing sialic acid.

The NH2-terminal sequence of the first 51 residues was obtained by automated Edman degradation. The intact protein was then treated with a Tachypleus clotting enzyme, to form a gel and to remove an internal peptide C (28 residues) located near the NH2-terminal portion. The gel protein, which consisted of A chain (18 residues) and B chain (129 residues), was S-alkylated and the resulting two chains were separated by acetone precipitation. Among these segments, A chain and peptide C were assigned to the NH2-terminal portion of whole coagulogen, as judged from their amino acid compositions. On the other hand, the covalent structure of B chain was determined by sequencing the peptides obtained from its tryptic digest. The alignments of the tryptic peptides were deduced from the sequence homology in comparison with the previously established B chain sequence of Japanese horseshoe crab (T. tridentatus) coagulogen. T. gigas coagulogen had a total of 175 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 19,770. When the sequence was compared with those of Japanese and American horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) coagulogens, extensive structural homology was found: T. tridentatus/T. gigas, 87% and L. polyphemus/T. gigas, 67%.

The distribution of immunoreactive FMRFamide (irFMRFamide) was mapped by immunofluorescence and the distribution corresponded to regional RIA data. A good proportion of the CNS and cardiac ganglion neuropile contained irFMRFamide, and fluorescent cell bodies were observed in several areas. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to separate and characterize the FMRFamide-like peptides from extracts of Limulus brains. HPLC fractions were analyzed using coincidental radioimmunoassay and bioassay (the radula protractor muscle of Busycon contrarium). There appear to be at least three FMRFamide-like peptides in the Limulus brain, including one similar to clam FMRFamide. FMRFamide acts on Limulus heart in a biphasic manner at relatively high concentrations (10(-5)M), but has no effect on the activity of the isolated ventral nerve cord. These data suggest that in Limulus FMRFamide-like peptides are acting as neurotransmitters, or neuromodulators.",10.1016/0196-9781(84)90089-5,

This fragment contains 203 residues, has Mr = 23,600, and is the NH2-terminal segment of the molecule. Comparison of this sequence with the first 87 residues of the NH2-terminal sequence of the alpha chain of hemocyanin from the Japanese horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus, of the Western Pacific (Nemoto, T., and Takagi, T. (1981) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 670, 79-83) shows that 46% of the residues are identical. Residues 172-177, -His-His-Trp-His-Trp-His-, appear to constitute at least part of the copper-binding site. This conclusion is supported by our finding that 40% of the residues in the sequence 172-186 are identical to residues 188-202 in tyrosinase from Neurospora; residues 188 and 193 in tyrosinase are known to be copper-binding histidines (Pfiffner, E., and Lerch, K.

When the preparations at slack length (sarcomere length, 7-9 microns) were locally activated with iontophoretically applied Ca ions, the A-band length did not change appreciably while the activated sarcomeres shortened linearly with a velocity similar to the maximum shortening velocity measured on intact muscle fibers. If, on the other hand, previously stretched preparations (sarcomere length, 11-14 microns) were locally activated, the A-band length first increased by 40-50% and then shortened to the initial length, while the activated sarcomeres continued to shorten. These results indicate that the thick filament shortening may not be associated with the physiological sarcomere shortening; the transient A-band lengthening with long initial sarcomere lengths may result from the transient misalignment of the thick filaments followed by their realignment, implying that the force exerted by the cross-bridge is not constant but may vary according to its past history.",10.1007/978-1-4684-4703-3_10,

The agglutination pattern with various S. aureus strains having N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-associated teichoic acid, teichoic acid without this sugar, and no teichoic acid indicated that this cell wall component is not the sole binding site for the lectin on intact S. aureus cells.

Shortly after this adherence or primary attachment, the sperm acrosome reaction occurs, resulting in a stronger adhesion (secondary attachment). A sperm attachment assay that quantified the number of spermatozoa attaching to egg sections was utilized to identify components involved in primary attachment. The number of spermatozoa attached was examined after treatment of either egg sections or spermatozoa with various compounds. Egg sections treated with asparagus pea lectin (250 micrograms/ml) bound significantly fewer spermatozoa as compared to those exposed to wheat germ agglutinin, concanavalin A, and garden pea lectin. Furthermore, sperm attachment was also greatly reduced when egg sections were first incubated with the glycosidase, alpha-L-fucosidase (less than or equal to 5% of controls). Treatment of spermatozoa with alpha-L-fucose, fucoidan, or p-aminophenyl fucoside also reduced sperm attachment when compared to Millipore-filtered artificial seawater controls. Egg sections were treated with fluorescein-conjugated lectins to confirm that the lectins actually bound to portions of the egg envelope and that various sugars are present in the egg envelope.

The method for purification consisted of gel-filtration of the lysate on a pyrogen-free Sepharose CL-6B column and affinity chromatography of the endotoxin-treated clotting enzyme on a benzamidine-Sepharose 4B column. Through these procedures, about 3 mg of the purified enzyme was obtained from 70 ml of the lysate and about 390-fold purification was achieved. The purified preparation was found to give a single major band, respectively, on polyacrylamide-gel disc electrophoresis at pH 3.2 in the presence of 6 M urea and on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. It also gave a single symmetrical peak on QAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography. The molecular weight of the clotting enzyme was estimated to be approximately 42,000 for the unreduced sample by SDS-gel electrophoresis. For the reduced sample, it was 30,000, suggesting that the protein consists of plural polypeptide chains bridged by disulfide(s). The Tachypleus clotting enzyme was a glycoprotein, as shown by the positive periodic acid-Schiff reaction for the protein band on SDS-gel and the amino acid analysis. The purified clotting enzyme transformed Tachypleus coagulogen to coagulin gel and hydrolyzed a chromogenic peptide substrate, Tos-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide for Factor Xa, liberating p-nitroaniline. The enzyme was sensitive to DFP and benzamidine. It was also inhibited partially by PCMB. Antithrombin III and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor (alpha 2-antiplasmin) were very effective inhibitors of this enzyme among ten kinds of naturally occurring proteinase inhibitors tested. The clotting enzyme had a restricted specificity towards protein substrates and activated only prothrombin among plasma zymogens including Factor IX, Factor X, fibrinogen, plasminogen and prekallikrein. The cleavage sites of bovine prothrombin for this enzyme were the same Arg-Thr and Arg-Ile linkages as those for Factor Xa, resulting in the formation of alpha-thrombin. These results indicate that the horseshoe crab clotting enzyme is a Factor Xa-like serine proteinase rather than alpha-thrombin.

Androctonus sera give higher titers than Limulus sera with erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Both sera show more avidity for leukemic than for normal lymphocytes. Limulus sera fail to agglutinate neuraminidase-treated cells but Androctonus sera react with untreated and neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes at the same degree. Sialyl-lactose is the best inhibitor for Androctonus sera, followed by N-acetylneuraminic and N-glycolylneuraminic acids, glucuronic and galacturonic acids, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. The amounts of inhibitor required depend upon the particular cell and enzyme treatment: agglutination of neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes by Androctonus is inhibited by lower concentrations of the same compounds that inhibit untreated erythrocytes agglutination. Results suggest that although Limulus and Androctonus have specificity for sialic acid containing compounds, on the cell surface, the Limulus receptors might be different from Androctonus receptors.",,

539,Neuroanatomy of the visual afferents in the horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus).,"S C Chamberlain, R B Barlow",1980,"The central nervous system of Limulus consists of a circumesophageal ring of fused ganglia and a paired ventral nerve cord. The anterior portion, the protocerebrum, receives sensory inputs including visual information. Three optic nerves, one each from the lateral eye, median ocellus, and ventral eye enter each side of the protocerebrum. The central connections of each optic nerve were determined by staining cut nerve trunks with cobalt chloride. The lateral optic nerve innervates the lamina, medulla, optic tract, ventral central body, and ocellar ganglion. The branching patterns of single axons, probably those of eccentric cells in the lateral eye retina, were observed. Single, large-diameter axons in the lateral optic nerve ramify at seven loci including sites in each of the structures innervated by the lateral optic nerve as a whole. The median optic nerve innervates the ocellar ganglion, central body, optic tract, and medulla. Three types of branching patterns were observed for single, large-diameter fibers in the median optic nerve. One type bypasses the ocellar ganglion and innervates the central body. A second type passes through the ocellar ganglion and optic tract without branching and innervates the posterior medulla. A third type innervates the ocellar ganglion, ventral central body, optic tract, and medulla. The ventral optic nerve is composed of large-diameter axons of ventral photoreceptors. Each axon enters the ganglion cell layer of the medulla and branches over a planar area less than 150 micrograms in diameter. We also observed that axons from mechanoreceptors on the anterior carapace innervate the posterior neuropil of the medulla, and that about 5% of the neurons in the medullar ganglion cell layer send axons to the ipsilateral circumesophageal connective.",10.1002/cne.901920212,

556,The brain of the horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus). III. Cellular and synaptic organization of the corpora pedunculata.,W H Fahrenbach,1979,"The large, hemispherical mass of the Limulus corpora pedunculata consists of two highly branched lobes, each connected to the protocerebrum by a narrow stalk. About 10(4) afferent fibers enter through the stalks and make diverse, profuse, and often reciprocal contacts with several million Kenyon (intrinsic) cells and one another. The Kenyon cell axonal arborizations converge on a few hundred efferent dendrites. The afferent fiber types can be classified into five types. Type A forms the club-shaped core of glomeruli and circumglomerular annuli, and contains small flat vesicles, suggesting an inhibitory function. Type B terminates with bushy endings in glomeruli and is presynaptic to both Kenyon cells and to Type A terminals. It has clear round vesicles and is the presumptive excitatory input. Type C terminates on other afferents, in glomeruli, and rarely on Kenyon cell bodies, contains angular (neurosecretory) granules and is postulated to impart circadian rhythm. Type D terminates on Kenyon cell somata and the initial neurite segment (but not in glomeruli), and contains dense-cored vesicles. Type E terminates in peduncles on other afferents and Kenyon cell telodendria. It contains dense vesicles. The C, D, and E afferents have reciprocal synaptic connections with Kenyon cell axon terminals. Glomeruli thus receive three different inputs of presumptive inhibitory (A), excitatory (B), and neuromodulatory nature (C). Kenyon cells, increasing in number up to about 1 x 10(8) in the adult, show minor variations in their dendritic pattern and have only one rare variant cell type. Interactions between them occur primarily at their axonal boutons as they crowd around efferent fibers. The latter have large receptive fields, some of their large somata are located within the confines of the corpora pedunculata, and they receive input almost only from Kenyon cells. Numerical and directional details of the circuitry in the corpora pedunculata have been extracted by a combination of light and electron microscopy, serial sectioning, silver staining, and stereology. The corpora pedunculata appear to process primarily the voluminous chemosensory input from the appendages, an assumption that is supported by the major connections of the organ.",10.1016/0040-8166(79)90016-8,

These EF particles, both when free or assembled into macular arrays, possess a central channel or pore. Numerous formed gap junctions are present in Limulus mid-gut, which suggests that cell-to-cell communication is an important feature of the mature tissue.

The subunits have similar molecular weights, 65,000 to 70,000, and their amino acid compositions are remarkably similar to each other and to other arthropod and molluscan hemocyanins. Digestion of the native subunits of Limulus hemocyanin by formic acid or trypsin shows considerable structural diversity which is supported by cyanogen bromide cleavage patterns and by peptide mapping of the tryptic peptides prepared from denatured hemocyanin subunits. The structural differentiation of the subunits is accompanied by functional differentiation, as shown in previous investigations of their O2 and CO affinities (Sullivan, B., Bonaventura, J., and Bonaventura, C.

The isolated material gave a single protein band on analytical gel electrophoresis at pH 3.2, gel electrofocusing, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis with or without 2-mercaptoethanol. It was 90 percent coagulable, and the total yield from 10 ml of the amoebocyte lysate was about 40 mg. The sedimentation coefficient of purified coagulogen was 2.6 S and its molecular weight was estimated to be about 15,300 by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. The molecular weight estimated by SDS-gel electrophoretic analysis was 19,500 +/- 1,000. This discrepancy was apparently due to abnormal mobility arising from the basic nature of this protein on electrophoresis. The protein had a high isoelectric point of pH 10.0 +/- 0.2, as measured by the isoelectric focusing technique. It consisted of a total of 132 to 135 amino acid residues and contained high levels of basic amino acids, which accounted for more than 16 per cent of the total amino acid residues. No methionine was detected. High contents of valine, half-cystine, glutamic acid (glutamine), and phenylalanine were found. The N-terminal sequence of the first three residues of the coagulogen was Ala-Asx-Thr, and its C-terminal residues was identified as phenylalanine, indicating that it consists of a single polypeptide chain.

The muscle fibers vary in size but are small in diameter, when compared with other arthropod skeletal muscles. They are striated with A, I, Z and poorly defined H bands. The sarcomere length ranges from 3-10 μm with most sarcomeres in the range of about 6 μm. The myofilaments are arranged in lamellae in larger fibers and less well organized in the smaller ones. Each thick filament is surrounded by 9-12 thin filaments which overlap. The SR is sparse but well organized to form a fenestrated collar around the fibrils. Individual SR tubules are also seen among the myofibrils. Long transverse tubules extend inward from the sarcolemma to form dyads or triads with the SR at the A-I junction. Both dyads and triads coexist in a single muscle fiber, a feature believed to have evolutionary significance. The neuromuscular relationship is unique. In the region of synaptic contact, the sarcolemma is usually elevated to form a large club-shaped structure containing no myofilaments and few other organelles.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in the presence of urea at pH 4.5, demonstrated patterns similar to those observed with amebocyte lysate. Extracts of the granules were gelled by bacterial endotoxin. The blood of the horseshoe crab contains only one type of cell, the amebocyte. Previous studies have shown that the blood coagulation mechanism of Limulus is contained entirely within amebocytes. The current studies suggest that the granules, which pack the cytoplasm of these cells, contain all of the factors required for the coagulation of blood, including the clottable protein. The intracellularly localized coagulation system is released from amebocytes when their granules rupture during cell aggregation.",10.1002/jcp.1040860310,

The enzyme was a tetramer with a molecular weight of about 160,000. The enzyme activity was inhibited by reduction with borohydride in the presence of the substrate and was inactivated by carboxypeptidase A [EC 3.4.12.2] digestion. The pH optima for fructose-diphosphate (FDP) and fructose-1-phosphate (F1P) activities were 6.5--8 and 7.5--8.2, respectively. The ratio of FDP/F1P activities was 30 and Km values were 1.7 times 10- minus 5 M and 2.5 times 10- minus 3 M, respectively, for the two substrates. The horseshoe crab aldolase was classified as class 1, type A, based on the results obtained.

The enzyme, like enzymes from other sources, was a tetramer with a subunit molecular weight of 36,000. The kinetic parameters and pH optimum were also similar to those of other enzymes, though the enzyme was more stable against heat and pH denaturations. 2 Analysis of SH groups showed that there were 4 SH groups per subunit, one of which was essential for the enzyme activity and was highly reactive. 3. CD spectra of the enzyme suggested that the enzyme had a very high content of beta-structure (ca. 45 per cent). 4. The horseshoe crab enzyme could form a hybrid in vitro with the rabbit muscle enzymes in concentrated salt solution at acidic pH. 5. There results indicate that the enzyme has overall structural similarity to other enzymes and that the enzyme is highly conserved during a long period of evolution.

596,"Functional differences in the multiple hemocyanins of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus L.","B Sullivan, J Bonaventura, C Bonaventura",1974,"Hemocyanin in the hemolymph of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus L., is a high-molecular-weight copper protein which binds oxygen cooperatively and shows a higher oxygen affinity at pH 7 than at pH 9. Treatment with EDTA (ethylenediaminetetra-acetate) disaggregates the hemocyanin molecules and abolishes both the reverse Bohr effect and cooperative oxygen binding. Chloride ions interact with the EDTA-treated material and, in the presence of saturating amounts of NaCl, a reverse Bohr effect is restored, but cooperativity is not. The EDTA-treated hemocyanin contains at least five electrophoretically distinct hemocyanins. These hemocyanins have similar molecular weights (about 66,000) but are functionally dissimilar. They have different oxygen affinities and different responses to chloride ions. The effect of chloride ions on unfractionated hemocyanin is due to pH-dependent chloride interactions with only two of the five hemocyanin components. The functional differences between the hemocyanin components may provide Limulus with a valuable respiratory flexibility in its interaction with the environment. The kinetics of oxygen combination and dissociation for the various hemocyanin preparations show that variations in the rate of oxygen dissociation are primarily responsible for the observed differences in oxygen affinity. The rate of oxygen dissociation varies 20-fold under conditions where the apparent rate of oxygen combination shows less than a 2-fold variation. Cooperative interactions in the untreated hemocyanin are most obvious in the ""off"" reaction, which increases in rate as successive oxygen molecules are released.",10.1073/pnas.71.6.2558,

The nucleus compacts to a spherical shape, but retains a much less condensed nuclear appendage, whose unique pores are each surrounded by a microtubule. The appendage, unmodified mitochondria, glycogen, and coated vesicles, all present in the mature spermatozoon, suggest an unusual degree of metabolic self-sufficiency of the cell. The acrosome is associated with a 50 μ-long acrosomal filament that penetrates the nucleus during spermiogenesis and coils up in the cytoplasm, enveloped by two outer nuclear membranes. The filament, which eventually comes to lie in the circumnuclear cisterna, retains a covering of one membrane during its discharge at the time of the acrosome reaction. The posterior region of the head forms a thin-walled collar with peculiar internal supports around the base of the flagellum. Serverance of intercellular bridges between spermatids, cytoplasm elimination, and rupture of the cyst precede liberation of the immature spermatozoa into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. Notwithstanding its peculiarities, the Limulus spermatozoon, with its simple shape closely resembling that of annelids and molluscs, represents the most primitive arthropod spermatozoon congruent with the evolutionary stability of the xiphosurans.",10.1002/jmor.1051400104,

Extracts of the central nervous system of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, were assayed for chromatophorotropic activity on the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator. The extracts caused pigment dispersion in the melanophores and pigment concentration in the leucophores but had no effect on the erythrophores. 2. The ethanol-soluble and 95% methanol:chloroform (2:1)-soluble fractions of the central nervous system from the horseshoe crab evoked melanin-dispersing and white pigment-concentrating responses which had larger amplitudes and longer durations than did the responses caused by extracts prepared directly in saline. 3. Neither gel filtration nor acetone fractionation was effective in separating the melanin-dispersing activity from the white pigment-concentrating activity in extracts of the central nervous system of the horseshoe crab. These responses appear to be caused by either the same molecule or by different substances having similar elution patterns from Bio-Gel P-6. 4. Extracts of the eyestalk of the fiddler crab were fractionated on Bio-Gel P-6. The melanin-dispersing, white pigment-dispersing and red pigment-dispersing activities were eluted with an Rf of 0.57, the same value as that of the major peaks of melanin-dispersing and white pigment-concentrating activities from the central nervous system of the horseshoe crab. In contrast, the white pigment-concentrating and red pigment-concentrating activities of the fiddler crab separated from the pigment-dispersing activities, having been eluted later from the column of Bio-Gel P-6 with an Rf of 0.28. 5. The chromatophorotropic material in the central nervous system of the horseshoe crab is more closely related to the melanin-dispersing material of the fiddler crab than to the white pigment-concentrating hormone of the fiddler crab. 6. The chromatophorotropins in the central nervous system of the horseshoe crab and the radial nerves of the sea star differ from each other in their elution patterns from a column of Bio-Gel P-6 and in the chromatophore responses they evoke in the fiddler crab.",10.2307/1540275,

Ultrastructure.","R A Leyton, E H Sonnenblick",1971,"The fine structure of the cardiac muscle of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, has been studied with respect to the organization of its contractile material, and the structure of its organelles and the cell junctions. Longitudinal sections show long sarcomeres (5.37 micro at L(max)), wide A bands (2.7 micro), irregular Z lines, no M line, and no apparent H zone. Transverse sections through the S zone of the A band show that each thick filament is ca. 180 A in diameter, is circular in profile with a center of low density, and is surrounded by an orbit of 9-12 thin filaments, each 60 A in diameter. Thick filaments are confined to the A band: thin filaments originate at the Z band, extend through the I band, and pass into the A band between the thick filaments. The sarcolemmal surface area is increased significantly by intercellular clefts. Extending into the fiber from these clefts and from the sarcolemma, T tubules pass into the fiber at the A-I level. Each fibril is enveloped by a profuse membranous covering of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Sacculations of the SR occur at the A-I boundary where they make diadic contact with longitudinal branches of the T system. These branches also extend toward the Z, enlarge at the Z line, and pass into the next sarcomere. Infrequently noted were intercalated discs possessing terminal insertion and desmosome modifications, but lacking close junctions (fasciae occludentes). These structural details are compared with those of mammalian cardiac and invertebrate muscles.",10.1083/jcb.48.1.101,

A total of 128 adult horseshoe crabs were collected from Honda Bay, Palawan, Philippines. These were identified as Tachypleus tridentatus (68 males, 40 females) and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda (2 males, 18 females). Morphology, morphometric measurements, and ratios of male and female of each species were described. Morphological characteristics in differentiating a male from a female crab involve examination of the appearance of the genitalia. Morphological characteristics in identifying the species include the presence or absence of notches in the frontal margin, arching in the frontal view, appearance of the chelae of the 2nd and 3rd prosomal appendages, number of lateral spines and the immovable spines in the opisthosoma, the presence of spinnerets on the surface of the telson, and shape of the telson and its cavity in cross-section. This study confirmed the identification of the two species found in Palawan, Philippines, and the morphological characteristics of the male and female of each species. In addition, a comparison was made of the size of the horseshoe crab species in Palawan with those found in other locations in the Asia-Pacific region.",10.31398/tpjf/29.2.2022-0017,http://dx.doi.org/10.31398/tpjf/29.2.2022-0017

Fauziyah, Mustopa AZ, Fatimah, Purwiyanto AIS, Rozirwan, Agustriani F, Putri WAE. 2021. Morphometric variation of the horseshoe crab Tachypleus gigas (Xiphosura: Limulidae) from the Banyuasin estuarine of South Sumatra, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 5061-5070. Morphological studies are essential for fish resource management, ecology, conservation, and stock assessment. This research was conducted to characterize the morphological variation of the coastal horseshoe crab (Tachypleus gigas) from the Banyuasin estuarine, South Sumatra, Indonesia. The body weight (BW), prosoma width (PW), carapace length (CL), telson length (TEL), and total length (TL) were measured for describing the morphometric variability of T. gigas. A total of 70 T. gigas (32 females and 38 males) were found using trammel net fishing and bottom gillnet during the survey. Multivariate and allometric methods analyzed their morphometric characters. Based on Kruskal- Wallis tests, the result showed a significant difference in somebody measurements (TL and CL) between males and females. The principal component analysis (PCA) results showed that all morphometric characters had a strong correlation in both sexes, so the first principal component (PC1) values were 92% and 72%. In comparison, the second principal component (PC2) values were 5% and 20% in females and males, respectively. The results of discriminant function analysis (DFA) suggested that only one (BW) of the five morphometric characters was significant in separating both sexes. Both sexes were also revealed variations in growth patterns based on the allometric analysis results. These results were expected to be used as a basis for managing the horseshoe crab population-based conservation.",10.13057/biodiv/d221143,http://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d221143

Ismail",2022,"Background: Serine Proteases in the Tachypleus Amoebocyte Lysate (TAL) from horseshoe crab, Tachpleus tridentatus have many applications in biomedical industries. The sensitivity of these enzymes is a crucial factor for such usages. Until today, the catalytic behavioural and biochemical stability of these enzymes has not been properly addressed. This report aimed to characterize the physicochemical properties of serine proteases to determine their kinetic reactions and to determine the potential utilization of the enzymes for endotoxin detection. Methods: The purification process of protease from crude TAL was performed using a two-phase filtration unit by affinity and gel columns and the molecular weights of the enzyme fraction from crude, affinity and gel filtration columns were determined. The Azocasein, Aldolase and transaldolase assays were used for the determination of the enzyme Catalysis. The chromogenic assay was carried out to determine the bacterial endotoxin effects using a standard endotoxin from strain Escherichia coli 0113: H10 as a positive control. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm. The enzyme activity was determined using the constructed p-nitroanilide standard curve. Result: A 72 kDa trypsin-like enzyme was purified at fraction-14 (F14) gel filtration and identified as transaldolase. The purified-F14 hydrolysed trypsin substrate, Ná-Benzoyl-L-Arginine-p-nitroanilide at higher activity than chymotrypsin. In conclusion, the purified enzyme showed a great potential for enhancing the TAL sensitivity.",10.18805/ijar.bf-1574,http://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.bf-1574

Sonnenblick",1971,"The fine structure of the cardiac muscle of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, has been studied with respect to the organization of its contractile material, and the structure of its organelles and the cell junctions. Longitudinal sections show long sarcomeres (5.37 µ at Lmax), wide A bands (2.7 µ), irregular Z lines, no M line, and no apparent H zone. Transverse sections through the S zone of the A band show that each thick filament is ca. 180 A in diameter, is circular in profile with a center of low density, and is surrounded by an orbit of 9–12 thin filaments, each 60 A in diameter. Thick filaments are confined to the A band: thin filaments originate at the Z band, extend through the I band, and pass into the A band between the thick filaments. The sarcolemmal surface area is increased significantly by intercellular clefts. Extending into the fiber from these clefts and from the sarcolemma, T tubules pass into the fiber at the A-I level. Each fibril is enveloped by a profuse membranous covering of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Sacculations of the SR occur at the A-I boundary where they make diadic contact with longitudinal branches of the T system. These branches also extend toward the Z, enlarge at the Z line, and pass into the next sarcomere. Infrequently noted were intercalated discs possessing terminal insertion and desmosome modifications, but lacking close junctions (fasciae occludentes). These structural details are compared with those of mammalian cardiac and invertebrate muscles.",10.1083/jcb.48.1.101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.48.1.101

It is a nucleated cell, the cytoplasm of which is packed with granules. The coagulation system of Limulus is contained exclusively within the amebocytes.Furthermore, factors necessary for blood coagulation are localized within their cytoplasmic granules. Cell-free plasma does not clot and is not required for coagulation. Aggregation and disruption of cells follow exposure of amebocytes to foreign surfaces. Endotoxin produces similar changes and in addition, results in coagulation of the blood, following release from amebocytes of the components of the coagulation mechanism.Coagulation, produced by endotoxin, is the result of activation by endotoxin of an enzyme (or series of enzymes) that in turn reacts with the clottable protein. Endotoxin does not react directly with the clottable protein. The rate of the reaction depends upon the concentration of endotoxin.",10.1055/s-0039-1682807,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1682807
1030,"Motor Control of Tail Spine Rotation of the Horseshoe Crab, <i>Limulus Polyphemus</i>",Gerald E. Silvey,1973,"ABSTRACT: Limulus polyphemus (L.), the horseshoe crab, rotates its tail spine in order to right tself and to keep itself balanced. Eight muscles, discrete bundles of muscle fibres, move the tail spine. Fibres of the muscles contract in sequence and thereby pull consecutively on the several tendons of each muscle in order to rotate the tail spine in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Motoneurones in nerves to different muscles, fibres within a muscle and units in a nerve to a single muscle fire in different sequences during clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the tail spine. The firing pattern consists of a major burst of small to large neurons which fire in clusters, and a minor burst of small neurones which appear to fire randomly. Motoneurones in both bursts are excitatory. The major burst develops tension, the minor burst acts during extension of the muscle and presumably impedes relaxation in order to produce stable deflexion and smooth rotation of the tail spine. Muscle fibres respond to motor output with small excitatory junctional potentials of &lt; 5 mV. E.j.p.s sum and show facilitation, and in some cases develop spike-like potentials of 10–20 mV. Both spiking and the greatest increase in tension occur during the clustered firings in major bursts. Muscle fibres have sarcomere lengths of 6·5 ± 0·8 –m and diameters of 10–60 –m. Nerve fibres range from less than 3 to 32 μm in diameter in large nerve branches which contain between 50 and 100 fibres. These findings indicate that two different motor programs evoke contraction of muscle fibres in opposite sequences. Sequential contraction of fibres within a muscle means that muscle fibres which are activated together, rather than whole muscles, are the functional contractile entities.",10.1242/jeb.58.3.599,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.58.3.599

Comparative genomics show that T. tridentatus and the Atlantic horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus had the most orthologs shared in only these two species, including genes involved in immune related Jak/STAT signaling pathway. Divergence time dating results show that the last common ancestor of Asian horseshoe crabs (including T. tridentatus) and L. polyphemus appeared at about 130 Mya (121-141) and the split of two Asian horseshoe crabs was dated to about 63 Mya (57-69). Hox gene analysis suggests two clusters in both horseshoe crab assemblies. Surprisingly, selective analysis of immune related gene families revealed high expansion of conservatively presented pattern recognition receptors. Genes involved in IMD and Jak/STAT signaling transduction pathways also exhibited a certain degree of expansion in both genomes. Intact coagulation cascade related genes were presented in T. tridentatus genome with a higher number of coagulation factor genes. Moreover, most antibacterial peptides reported have been identified in T. tridentatus with their potentially effective antimicrobial sites. Conclusions The well-developed innate immunity of T.tridentatus may affect the quality of the adaptive properties with regard to complicated marine environments.",10.21203/rs.2.9427/v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.2.9427/v1

However, the genetic mechanisms underlying their abilities of distinguishing and defending against invading microbes are still unclear. Results: Here, we describe the 2.06 Gbp genome assembly of Tachypleus tridentatus with 24,222 predicted protein-coding genes. Comparative genomics shows that T. tridentatus and the Atlantic horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus have the most orthologues shared among two species, including genes involved in the immune-related JAK-STAT signalling pathway. Divergence time dating results show that the last common ancestor of Asian horseshoe crabs (including T. tridentatus) and L. polyphemus appeared approximately 130 Mya (121-141), and the split of the two Asian horseshoe crabs was dated to approximately 63 Mya (57-69). Hox gene analysis suggests two clusters in both horseshoe crab assemblies. Surprisingly, selective analysis of immune-related gene families revealed the high expansion of conserved pattern recognition receptors. Genes involved in the IMD and JAK-STAT signal transduction pathways also exhibited a certain degree of expansion in both genomes. Intact coagulation cascade-related genes were present in the T. tridentatus genome with a higher number of coagulation factor genes. Moreover, most reported antibacterial peptides have been identified in T. tridentatus with their potentially effective antimicrobial sites. Conclusions: The draft genome of T. tridentatus would provide an important source for eliminating the uncertainty in the evolutionary relationship of Chelicerata. The expansion of conserved immune signalling pathway genes, coagulation factors and intact antimicrobial peptides in T. tridentatus constitutes its robust and effective innate immunity for self-defence in marine environments with an enormous number of invading pathogens and may affect the quality of the adaptive properties with regard to complicated marine environments.",10.21203/rs.2.9427/v3,http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.2.9427/v3

MtDNA clonal diversity was moderately high, particularly in southern samples, and a major genetic ""break"" (nucleotide sequence divergence approximately 2%) distinguished all sampled individuals which were north vs. south of a region in northeastern Florida. The area of genotypic divergence in Limulus corresponds to a long-recognized zoogeographic boundary between warm-temperate and tropical marine faunas, and it suggests that selection pressures and/or gene flow barriers associated with water mass differences may also influence the evolution of species widely distributed across such transition zones. On the other hand, a comparison of the mtDNA divergence patterns in Limulus with computer models involving stochastic lineage extinction in species with limited gene flow demonstrates that deterministic explanations need not necessarily be invoked to account for the observations. Experiments to distinguish stochastic from deterministic possibilities are suggested. Overall, the pattern and magnitude of mtDNA differentiation in horseshoe crabs is very similar to that typically reported for freshwater and terrestrial species assayed over a comparable geographic range. Results demonstrate for the first time that, geographically, at least some continuously distributed marine organisms can show considerable mtDNA genetic differentiation.",10.1093/genetics/112.3.613,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/genetics/112.3.613

Number of horseshoe crabs landed was enumerated and each prosoma size (prosoma length and width) was measured. Prosoma width of the horseshoe crabs was used as a morphometric proxy to estimate the approximate age and instar stage of the individual crabs. All horseshoe crabs examined were adult individuals. The carapaces of horseshoe crabs were carefully examined for epibiont infestation. The epibiont was identified to genus level.

Jane Brockmann, David Julian",2015,"Fertilized eggs of the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, are buried in shallow nests above the high tide line, where they are exposed to variations in abiotic conditions during early development. Using a multiple stressors approach we examined whether the rate of embryonic development is affected by exposure to combinations of three factors: temperature (T; 25, 30 and 35°C), salinity (S; 5, 15 and 34 ppt), and ambient O2 (O2; 5%, 13% and 21% O2). Newly fertilized eggs were incubated under 27 fully-factorial stressor combinations for 14 d, then allowed to recover in control conditions (30°C, 34 ppt, 21% O2) for an additional 14 d. Growth rate was measured every 2 d throughout the experiment (n=1296). We found that the effect of isolated stressors (high T, low S or low O2) reduced developmental success by up to 72% (low S), and that stressor combinations showed stronger effects and evidence of complex interactions. For example, low O2 had little effect individually but was lethal in combination with high T, and low T in isolation slightly decreased the rate of development but reduced the negative effects of low S and low O2. Development was delayed under exposure to low O2 but resumed upon return to control conditions after a 10 d lag. These data demonstrate that complex, synergistic interactions among abiotic stressors can substantially alter the development of a coastal invertebrate in ways that may not be predicted from the effects of the stressors in isolation.",10.1242/jeb.117184,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.117184

Iwanaga",1979,"Horseshoe crab coagulogen consists of a single basic polypeptide chain having the total 175 amino acid residues. Upon gelation of this protein, a large peptide, named peptide C, which has 28 amino acid residues, was released, and the resulting gel protein consisted of A and B chains, bridged by two disulfide linkages. The sequence studies on peptide C, A chain and B chain provided that their sequences have a significant homology partly with primate fibrinopeptide B and largely with human platelet factor 4. The facts suggest that these are derived from a common ancester or that the coagulogen is a prototype of platelet factor 4. The whole sequence of coagulogen was as follows:Ala-Asp-Thr-Asn-Ala-Pro-Ile-Cys-Leu-Cys-Asp-Glu-Pro-Gly-Val-Leu-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gln-Ile-Val-Thr-Thr-Glu-Ile-Lys-Asp-Lys-Ue-Glu-Lys-Ala-Val-Clu-Ala-Val-Ala-Gln-Glu-Ser-Gly-Val-Ser-Gly-Arg-Cly-Fhe-Ser-Ile-Phe-Ser-His-His-Pro-Val-Phe-Arg-Glu-Cys-Gly-Lys-Tyr-Glu-Cys-Arg-Thr-Val-Arg-Fro-Glu-Hls-Ser-Arg-Cys-Tyr-Asn-Phe-Pro-Pro-Phe-Thr-His-Phe-Lys-Leu-Glu-Cys-Pro-Val-Ser-Thr-Arg-Asp-Cys-Glu-Pro-Va1-Phe-Gly-Tyr-Thr-Va1-Ala-Gly-Glu-Phe-Arg-Va1-1le-Va1-GIn-Ala-Pro-Arg-Ala-Cly-Phe-Arg-GIn-Cys-Val-Trp-Cin-His-Lys-Cys-Arg-Phe-Giy-Ser-Asn-Ser-Cys-Gly-Tyr-Asn-Gly-Arg-Cys-Thr-Gln-Gln-Arg-Ser-Val-Val-Arg-Leu-Val-Thr-Tyr-Asn-Leu-Clu-Lys-Asp-Cly-Phe-Leu-Cys-Glu-Ser-Phe-Arg-Thr-Cys-Gys-Cly-Cys-Pro-Cys-Arg-Ser-Phe,",10.1055/s-0039-1684834,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1684834

Taking the irregular cellular structure of the tri-spine horseshoe crab as a research model, we present a new approach to the quantitative description and analysis of structure-property-function relationships. We employ a robust skeletonization method to construct a curve-skeleton that relies on high-resolution 3D tomographic data. The topological motifs and mechanical properties of the long-range cellular structure were investigated using the Grasshopper plugin and uniaxial compression test to identify the variation gradient. Finite element analysis was conducted for the sub-volumes to obtain the variation in effective modulus along the three principal directions. The results show that the branch length and node distribution density varied from the tip to the base of the sharp corner. These node types formed a low-connectivity network, in which the node types 3-N and 4-N tended to follow the motifs of ideal planar triangle and tetrahedral configurations, respectively, with the highest proportion of inter-branch angles in the angle ranges of 115–120° and 105–110°. In addition, mapping the mechanical gradients to topological properties indicated that narrower profiles with a given branch length gradient, preferred branch orientation, and network connectedness degree are the main factors that affect the mechanical properties. These factors suggest significant potential for designing a controllable, irregularly cellular structure in terms of both morphology and function.",10.1088/1748-3190/ac9207,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-3190/ac9207

One of the horseshoe crab species scattered in Indonesian sea waters is Tachypleus gigas. It was reported that the eggs of T. gigas contained flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, and steroids. Flavonoids are polyphenol compounds that have the ability as natural antioxidants. In this study, total phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant activity tests were carried out on the methanol extract of T. gigas eggs. The total phenolics content used the Folin Ciocalteu method, the total flavonoids used the aluminum chloride colorimetric method, and the antioxidant activity test used the FRAP and DPPH methods. The test results showed that the total phenolics and flavonoids were 0.53506 ± 0.001335 mg GAE/g extract and 0.52067 ± 0.000731 mg QE/g extract, respectively. Meanwhile, the results of the antioxidant activity test with the FRAP method obtained a total antioxidant capacity of 29.85 μmol in the medium category and antioxidant activity with the DPPH method obtained an IC50 value of 597.0397 μg/mL in the very weak category.",10.18596/jotcsa.1243140,http://dx.doi.org/10.18596/jotcsa.1243140

Lysis of amoebocytes did not change the amount of iron-binding protein in haemolymph samples. The protein was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified protein was estimated to be 282,000 +/- 10,000 Da by gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation. SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the protein is composed of ten subunits having a molecular mass of 28,000 +/- 2,000 Da. The purified, unlabelled protein efficiently sequestered 59Fe in the absence of haemolymph indicating that no other haemolymph factors are required for the incorporation of iron into the protein. No 59Fe was removed from the purified protein with EDTA or 2,2′-bipyridyl. Partial removal of 59Fe was achieved by dialysis with nitrilotriacetic acid or desferal. Analysis of the iron-loaded protein indicated that each subunit has the capacity to bind two iron atoms with high affinity. The isolation of an iron-binding protein from L. polyphemus supports the proposal that such proteins are an ancient evolutionary development not necessarily linked to the appearance of iron proteins which serve as oxygen carriers.",10.1042/bj2520151,http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/bj2520151

Treberg, Dirk Weihrauch",2018,"Many studies have investigated ammonia excretion and acid-base regulation in aquatic arthropods, yet current knowledge of marine chelicerates is non-existent. In American horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus), book gills bear physiologically distinct regions: dorsal and ventral half-lamellae, and central mitochondria-rich (CMRA) and peripheral mitochondria-poor areas (PMPA). CMRA and ventral half-lamella exhibited characteristics important to ammonia excretion and/or acid-base regulation as supported by high expression levels of Rhesus-protein 1 (LpRh-1), cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase (CA-2), and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated K+ channel (HCN) compared to PMPA and dorsal half-lamella. The half-lamellae displayed remarkable differences; the ventral epithelium was ion-leaky whilst the dorsal counterpart possessed an exceptionally tight epithelium. LpRh-1 was more abundant than LpRh-2 in all investigated tissues, but LpRh-2 was more prevalent in the PMPA than CMRA. Ammonia influx associated with high ambient ammonia (HAA) treatment was counteracted by intact animals and complemented by upregulation of branchial CA-2, V-type H+-ATPase (HAT), HCN, and LpRh-1 mRNA expression. The dorsal epithelium demonstrated characteristics of active ammonia excretion, however, an influx was observed across the ventral epithelium due to the tissue's high ion conductance, although the influx rate was not proportionately high considering the ∼3-fold inwardly-directed ammonia gradient. Novel findings suggest a role for the coxal gland in excretion and maintaining hemolymph ammonia regulation under HAA. Hypercapnic exposure induced compensatory respiratory acidosis and partial metabolic depression. Functional differences between 2 halves of a branchial lamella may be physiologically beneficial in reducing backflow of waste products into adjacent lamellae, especially in fluctuating environments where ammonia levels can increase.",10.1242/jeb.151894,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.151894

Fifty-five actively spawning females were fitted with transmitters in 2008 and 2009 and were tracked using acoustic telemetry from May 2008 through July 2010. Fifteen crabs with transmitters also had archive depth-temperature tags attached. In addition, over 2000 spawning crabs (males and females) were tagged with US Fish and Wildlife (USFWS) button tags over the same period. Ninety-one percent of the crabs with transmitters were detected during this study. In the spring, crabs were primarily located in the northern section of the bay near spawning beaches, whereas in the fall crabs moved towards the deeper portions of the bay, and some may have overwintered in the bay. There was evidence that a majority (58%–71%) of the females with transmitters spawned in two sequential seasons. One archive tag was recovered resulting in a year-long continuous record of depth and temperature data that, when integrated with telemetry data, indicated that the crab overwintered in the bay. The live recapture rate of crabs with USFWS button tags was 11%, with all re-sighted crabs except one observed inside Pleasant Bay. Eighty-three percent of recaptures were found within 2.5km of the tagging location, and 51% were observed at the same beach where they were tagged. This study provides further evidence that horseshoe crabs in Pleasant Bay may be philopatric to this embayment.",10.1093/czoolo/56.5.575,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/czoolo/56.5.575

1233,Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) detection of endotoxin in human blood,T.J. Novitsky,1994,"Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) has been applied to the detection of endotoxin in human serum, plasma and blood since the early 1970s. Although the diagnostic potential of LAL for endotoxemia was recognized immediately, the assay's modest sensitivity and specificity (for Gram-negative sepsis/bacteremia) were perceived as limiting the clinical usefulness of LAL. In an attempt to overcome these drawbacks, many studies have been conducted since the initial work by Levin and his colleagues. Numerous attempts have been made to improve the sensitivity of the assay by changing the formulation of the LAL and assay methodology. The original gel-clot method has for the most part been replaced with turbidimetric or chromogenic methods. The amount of endotoxin detectable within a 1 h incubation period has gone from the nanogram to the picogram range. Since blood (plasma) components interfere with the test, various methods to remove inhibition and/or enhancement have been developed. The chloroform extraction technique of Levin and co-workers has been replaced with acid extraction or with dilution and heating. Partitioning of endotoxin in blood may also influence the assay (recovery). Many recent investigators use platelet-rich plasma instead of ordinary plasma, while a few studies have used whole blood. Even with all the improvements, the specificity and related diagnostic usefulness of the LAL assay for Gram-negative sepsis remain an obstacle for regulatory acceptance. This may have more to do with our understanding of the septic process than with the ability of LAL to detect endotoxin. Although a recent study indicates that the type of Gram-negative bacteremia may be a critical determinant for clinical utility of the LAL test, the presence of endotoxin is not highly predictive of Gram-negative sepsis and vice versa. However, with the potential availability of anti-endotoxin therapy, the diagnosis of endotoxemia, with or without bacteremia, may be extremely important for timely and effective treatment modalities. It is concluded that the LAL test and accompanying sample preparation has evolved into a clinically useful test for the detection of circulating endotoxins and even its modest predictability for sepsis may have some clinical utility.",10.1177/096805199400100407,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/096805199400100407
1234,Heparin enables the reliable detection of endotoxin in human blood samples using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay,"Stephan Harm, Claudia Schildböck, Denisa Cont, Viktoria Weber",2023,"Abstract: The determination of lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) in serum or plasma samples using Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL)-based assays is currently not sufficiently reliable in clinical diagnostics due to numerous interfering factors that strongly reduce the recovery of LPS in clinical samples. The specific plasma components responsible for the endotoxin neutralizing capacity of human blood remain to be identified. There are indications that certain endotoxin-neutralizing proteins or peptides, which are part of the host defense peptides/proteins of the innate immune system may be responsible for this effect. Based on our finding that several antimicrobial peptides can be neutralized by the polyanion heparin, we developed a heparin-containing diluent for serum and plasma samples, which enables reliable quantification of LPS measurement in clinical samples using the LAL assay. In a study involving 40 donors, this improved protocol yielded an over 8-fold increase in LPS recovery in serum samples, as compared to the standard protocol. This modified protocol of sample pretreatment could make LPS measurement a valuable tool in medical diagnostics.",10.21203/rs.3.rs-3212156/v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3212156/v1

Satellite males form large groups around some couples while ignoring others, resulting in a nonrandom distribution that cannot be explained by local environmental conditions or habitat selection. In experimental manipulations, pairs that had satellites regained them after they had been removed whereas pairs with no satellites continued nesting alone, which means that satellites were not simply accumulating around the pairs that had been on the beach the longest. Manipulations also revealed that satellites were not just copying the behaviour of other males. Based on the evidence from observations and experiments, the most likely explanation for the nonrandom distribution of satellite males among nesting pairs is that unattached males are preferentially attracted to some females over others. Females with many satellites were larger and in better condition, but did not lay more eggs, than females with few or no satellites.",10.1111/j.1439-0310.1996.tb01099.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1996.tb01099.x

1282,Revitalizing the Population of Tachypleus tridentatus: A Comprehensive Study Tachypleus tridentatus Conservation in China,Ruiting Qiao,2023,"Tachypleus tridentatus is an ancient marine arthropod. Currently, the population of Tachypleus tridentatus has decreased rapidly, in 2019, the IUCN Red List officially updated the endangered status of Tachypleus tridentatus to Endangered (EN), indicating a global decline in the resources of this species. However, the lack of data, such as population baseline data, acts as a barrier for this nearshore habitat and medically important species. The results of this paper suggest that the main causes of the decline in the population of the Tachypleus tridentatus darter are overfishing and habitat destruction. In addition, the discussion focuses on three techniques presently employed in China to revive the population of Tachypleus tridentatus, including fisheries enhancement, habitat designation for conservation, and educational programs. The study also examines the advantages and disadvantages of conservation methods implemented in China, and while certain methods, such as moratoriums on aquaculture, show significant advantages, others, such as the establishment of protected habitats, have limitations due to incomplete findings. These methods provide a solid foundation for the conservation of the Tachypleus tridentatus, and also point to possible future directions, such as the implementation of polyculture. However, there is a need to improve the efficiency of existing methods through further development and additional data collection studies. To address the acknowledged limitations and gaps in this study, additional exploration and discourse are imperative to advance the preservation of Tachypleus tridentatus.",10.54097/vbhyb205,http://dx.doi.org/10.54097/vbhyb205

Samples from different sections of the exoskeleton were taken to evaluate chitin content and properties in order to be compared with exuviae. The isolation of chitin was realized by chemical processes involving deproteinization, demineralization and discoloration. Physicochemical properties of chitin extracted from both sources were compared in terms of characterization analysis in particular achieved under EDX, FTIR and calorimetric techniques (DSC and TGA). In such comparative analysis lies the importance to establish differences or similitudes in chitin contents, structure, etc. Scanning Electron Microcopy was conducted on exuviae and exoskeleton selected parts in order to identify horseshoe crab structure and surface morphology. Differential scanning calorimetry was focused on changes in physical and chemical structures at different samples showing two endothermic peaks related to the complete elimination of hydroxyl groups attached to polysaccharide rings. TGA thermograms were characterized by endo and exotherms corresponding to water evaporation and decomposition of polymer respectively. Exoskeleton SEM images shown a tubular network and porous surface while exuviae exhibited irregular surface and diatom unicellular microalgae embedded. Calorimetric measurements confirmed that exuviae is richer in chitin than exoskeleton and that the main allotropic crystal structure corresponds to α‐chitin. FTIR analysis supported these results by exhibiting different absorption bands corresponding to α‐chitin.",10.1002/slct.202000085,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/slct.202000085

A detailed description of the transverse tubular system and the sarcoplasmic reticulum is also given. Of special interest is the possibility that the muscle fibers may be split into ""units"" of different diameters.The sarcomere length of fibers in the seven muscles was determined to see if both long and short sarcomere length fibers are present. The distribution of fiber sarcomere lengths in each muscle is unimodal, and mean values for each of the different muscles range from 7.6 to 8.5 μ. The ultrastructural features of fibers in each muscle also are similar. Therefore, it appears that horseshoe crab leg skeletal muscles are composed structurally of a fairly uniform population of fibers and that fast and slow categories of fibers, at least as defined for other arthropods, are not present in the horseshoe crab muscles studied here.",10.1139/z72-193,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z72-193

Activation of the cell-lysate proclotting enzyme, utilizing a diluted lysate preparation and synthetic substrates, was inhibited to a comparable extent with either anticoagulantly active or inactive heparin. Other glycosaminoglycans, including heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin 4-sulfate, and chondroitin 6-sulfate, did not inhibit the generation of clotting enzyme activity. Experiments conducted with preparations of proactivator(s) and proclotting enzyme, obtained by fractionation of lysate with heparin-Sepharose, revealed that inhibition of endotoxin-dependent activation of amebocyte lysate by heparin is mediated by precipitation of the proactivator(s) and can be prevented by increasing the salt concentration.",10.1055/s-0038-1646579,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1646579

The following were considered: sperm motility, attachment of sperm to egg, acrosome reaction, and penetration of the acrosomal filament. The spermatozoa after semination are non-motile and become active only in close proximity to a defined region surrounding the egg. Egg materials diffusing into this region induce sperm motility and stimulate large numbers of spermatozoa to move towards the egg surface. Each sperm initially attaches by the apical tip and undergoes the acrosome reaction which causes a more permanent secondary attachment by the adhesion of acrosomal contents to the egg surface. The acrosome reaction also initiates the penetration of the acrosomal filament through the egg envelope, an event occurring in 70–80% of the attached spermatozoa (about 106). Shortly after this penetration, a secondary reaction occurs which involves a spiralling of the flagellum and an incorporation into the sperm body of the flagellar fibrous components, which then become closely apposed to the sperm nucleus.",10.1242/jcs.22.3.547,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jcs.22.3.547

The American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemusLinnaeus, 1758, expresses circalunidian locomotor rhythms and circadian eye sensitivity rhythms, but it is not clear if either heart and ventilation rates are controlled on a circadian, or circatidal basis or the nature of the relationship between these three measures. We aimed to determine the extent to which the heart and ventilation rates of L. polyphemus are coordinated with its endogenous rhythms of locomotion. We recorded rhythmic beating of the heart and movements of the gill plates in freely moving horseshoe crabs. Most individuals exhibited robust circatidal rhythms of locomotion, heart rate, and ventilation that were highly correlated with each other over three weeks of continuous recording. These results are the first showing long-term rhythms of all three measures in any marine species and suggest that heart rate and ventilation rhythms are coordinated in L. polyphemus, both with each other, and with locomotion, and thus are all modulated on a tidal basis.",10.1093/jcbiol/ruad069,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jcbiol/ruad069

Thirty-seven vials of six different immunoglobulin products were analyzed for the LAL-reactive material by combined use of a conventional chromogenic Limulus test and a chromogenic endotoxin-specific test. The amount of LAL-reactive material in reconstituted immunoglobulin solutions ranged from a mean (standard deviation) of 10.2 (2.1) to 2,448.1 (988.9) pg/ml, and there were statistically significant differences among the six brands. The levels of LAL-reactive material in plasma increased in proportion to the amounts contained in the immunoglobulin products administered. The material accumulated in the blood with repeated administration. Urinary excretion of the material was less than 5% of the total amount administered. Such material seems to be derived from the cellulose-based membranes used during preparation of the blood products.

The glucans included two kinds of beta-(1,3)-D-glucans, laminarin and curdlan, and cellulosic material, LAL-reactive material (LAL-RM), extracted from a hollow-fiber (Cuprophan) hemodialyzer. LAL-RM loses its LAL activity when it is digested with cellulase and thus appears to be a beta-(1,4)-D-glucan or a mixed glucan containing a substantial proportion of beta-(1,4) linkages. All LAL reagents tested were at least 1,000-fold more sensitive to endotoxin than to LRGs. The presence of the surfactant Zwittergent was shown to interfere with reactivity to LRGs; LAL reagents without added Zwittergent reacted more strongly to LRGs than did the same reagents containing Zwittergent. Chloroform extraction of LAL increased the reagents' sensitivity to both endotoxin and LRGs, but it was not responsible for LRG reactivity. The addition of Zwittergent significantly reduced the sensitivity of LAL reagents to lipid A. LAL without the surfactant was equally sensitive to endotoxin and lipid A. Both curdlan and LAL-RM amplified or enhanced the LAL response to endotoxin. Kinetic turbidimetric studies demonstrated that the enhancement was dependent on the glucan concentration.",10.1128/jcm.29.11.2477-2483.1991,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/jcm.29.11.2477-2483.1991

1362,Using Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) to discover the presence of endotoxins in the tanks at the Pritzker Marine Biology Research Center,Sydney Haas,2023,"Endotoxins are harmful for many organisms, including those that live in the water. Therefore, it is important to identify effective ways in identifying if they are present in water environments. Research has been conducted to show that Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) is an effective way to determine if endotoxins are present. In this study, LAL was used as the main reagent to detect if endotoxins were present in the tanks at the Pritzker Marine Biology Research Center. It is believed that LAL will be able to detect the presence of any endotoxins within the tanks at Pritzker. The first part of the procedure to do this was to collect 5mL of water from each tank at Pritzker. After the LAL reagent was dissolved in LAL Reagent Water, the gel-clot assay was then produced. 0.1mL of the reagent was added to each assay tube. 0.1mL of each product sample or control was transferred into each assay tube, beginning with the negative control and ending with the highest endotoxin concentration. The contents of the tubes were mixed and incubated undisturbed in a 37 C heating block for 60 minutes. After incubation, each tube was examined for gelation. A positive test is defined as the formation of a firm gel capable of maintaining its integrity when the assay tube is inverted 180 degrees. A negative test is characterized by the absence of gel or by the formation of a viscous mass which does not hold when the assay tube is inverted. Endotoxins were detected in an average of 13 tanks at the Pritzker. To expand upon these findings, quantifying how many endotoxins are present in the tanks and what types of endotoxins are present in the tanks will be tested.",10.1152/physiol.2023.38.s1.5726593,http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/physiol.2023.38.s1.5726593

Therefore, endotoxin testing of nanomaterials is necessary to benchmark their influence on cells. Here, we tested the traditional Limulus amebocyte lysate gel clot assay for the detection of endotoxins in nanoparticle suspensions with a focus on possible interference of the particles with the test system. We systematically investigated the effects of nanomaterials made of, or covered by, the same material. Different types of bare or PEGylated silica nanoparticles, as well as iron oxide–silica core shell nanoparticles, were tested. Detailed inhibition/enhancement controls revealed enhanced activity in the Limulus coagulation cascade for all particles with bare silica surface. In comparison, PEGylation led to a lower degree of enhancement. These results indicate that the protein–particle interactions are the basis for the observed inhibition and enhancement effects. The enhancement activity of a particle type was positively related to the calculated particle surface area. For most silica particles tested, a dilution of the sample within the maximum valid dilution was sufficient to overcome non-valid enhancement, enabling semi-quantification of the endotoxin contamination.",10.1177/1753425913492833,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1753425913492833

LAL was formulated for optimal performance in either an endpoint procedure or a kinetic procedure with the chromogenic substrate, buffer, and LAL components colyophilized as a single reagent. The kinetic chromogenic method required an incubating microplate reader coupled to a computer for collection and analysis of data. The kinetic method had a longer incubation time than the endpoint method and spanned a range of over 3 orders of magnitude compared with the 1-order-of-magnitude range of the endpoint assay. The kinetic method was less subject to operator error, since readings were continuous and automatic. The endpoint test was more operator intensive, requiring both addition of acetic acid to stop the reaction and transfer of the sample to the reading device. A single-step chromogenic reagent was also prepared without lyophilization by mixing reconstituted gel clot LAL with a buffer and a chromogenic substrate.

In this study, we investigated which factors influence the recovery of endotoxins using limulus ameobocyte lysate (LAL)-based assays. The individual factors that were examined in more detail were lipoprotein content, type of blood anticoagulation, kinetics and serum levels of divalent cations. Furthermore, it was investigated whether there is a direct correlation between LAL activity and monocyte activation. We could show that polyanionic heparin increases endotoxin recovery in blood, while citrate anticoagulation promotes endotoxin neutralization. Furthermore, we could show that the endotoxin activity in human plasma and serum decreases strongly over time. Time-dependent endotoxin neutralization reaches its maximum after 4–6 h incubation. By means of filtration tests we could determine that endotoxins in the plasma bind to lipoproteins but do not influence their activity. Comparative measurements have shown that high LAL activity of endotoxins in plasma simultaneously possesses high monocyte activating properties in whole blood. For the maximum recovery of endotoxins in human blood the physiological calcium and magnesium concentrations are sufficient. In this study, it was shown that the endotoxin neutralizing plasma components have a molecular weight similar to β2-microglobulin (11.7 kDa). For the exact identification of the endotoxin neutralizing plasma components, which caused a modulation of the immunostimulating endotoxin activity, further investigations have to be carried out in the future.",10.1038/s41598-021-83487-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83487-4

Precursor molecules include diacylglucosamine 1-phosphates and tetraacyl disaccharide bis-phosphates. The activities of several of these compounds and of their derivatives were measured by Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. We report that (i) both mono- and disaccharide precursors of lipid A activate LAL, (ii) two acyl chains on the monosaccharide subunit of lipid A are necessary for activation of LAL, and (iii) the monosaccharide, 2-monoacylglucosamine 1-phosphate can competitively inhibit LAL activation by diacyl monosaccharide lipid A precursors. However, 2-monoacylglucosamine 1-phosphate did not inhibit endotoxin activation of LAL. One unanticipated finding was that the activities of the monosaccharides were reduced upon storage even though their covalent structures were unchanged. Perhaps this is due to alterations in physical state. Thus, these lipid A precursors and derivatives offer some insight into the structural features required for activation of the LAL assay and may in the future provide derivatives which are competitive inhibitors of endotoxin.",10.1128/iai.49.2.286-290.1985,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/iai.49.2.286-290.1985

Methods: Near‐shore animals were briefly manually restrained for hemolymph collection from the cardiac sinus. Hematologic samples (25 males, 25 females) were collected for hemocytometer counts using the Natt and Herrick method. A second set of 50 animals (25 males, 25 females) was sampled for biochemistry measurands, including copper concentration by spectrophotometer, osmolality by vapor pressure osmometer, and protein electrophoresis. Results: Total hemocyte counts varied widely (RI 6600‐44 300/µL). Electrolytes were consistent with osmoconformers living in seawater. There was a marked difference in sexes, with females showing much lower protein, glucose, and copper levels. Eleven females had multiple outliers, and all data were excluded from RI calculations. Conclusions: Further studies of this species outside of spawning season are needed. Expanding our knowledge of horseshoe crab health is important to decreasing morbidity and mortality in research applications and maximizing longevity and overall health in display settings.",10.1111/vcp.12983,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vcp.12983

Sodium chloride at a concentration of 4 M prevents clot formation by either precipitation or denaturation of procoagulase. The time necessary for the activation of procoagulase by endotoxin is increased by a change in the sodium chloride concentration from 0.15 M to 0.588 M. No effect on the proteolytic phase or the polymerization phase of the clotting reaction is detected by the increase in sodium chloride concentration from 0.15 M to 0.588 M. The authors conclude that increased sodium chloride concentrations may aid the isolation of procoagulase.,10.1055/s-0038-1646782,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1646782

Result: The CMSA results indicated that adult abundance of male and female horseshoe crabs was stable from 2003 to 2013 and then began to increase through 2017, a result that is consistent with stock rebuilding following a period of harvest restrictions as recommended by the ARM Framework. Population estimates were lower in recent years but remained above the levels estimated before implementation of the ARM Framework. In 2021, the CMSA estimated that there were over 6 million mature females and nearly 16 million mature male horseshoe crabs in the region.

Using lipooligosaccharide (LOS)-activated gelation of Limulus amebocyte lysate, we compared the relative abilities of outer membrane LOS of 10 N. meningitidis and 10 N. gonorrhoeae strains to initiate coagulation. A wide range of procoagulant potencies was observed for each species, and there was significant overlap of potencies between species. Relative biological activities did not correlate with the oligosaccharide components as defined by LOS molecular weight or specific antigenic epitopes. Purified lipid A of two LOS strains of different potency demonstrated relative procoagulant biological activities similar to those of their parent LOSs. When these lipid A preparations were further separated by thin-layer chromatography, the most polar component of each lipid A possessed the majority of the procoagulant activity. We concluded that the ability of neisserial LOS to initiate coagulation of Limulus lysate is a property of the lipid A portion of the molecule and is most likely determined by fine structural differences in the lipid A which are independent of species.",10.1128/iai.60.3.762-767.1992,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/iai.60.3.762-767.1992

Yet, little is known about the ability of early life history stages to detect and respond to visual cues. We examined the visually directed movements of larvae and first stage juveniles to horizons containing dark visual targets of different sizes. The study tested the hypotheses that (1) larval and juvenile crabs can detect and respond to visual targets and (2) the direction of orientation varies with the presence of chemical cues associated with settlement habitats. Orientation of larval and juvenile crabs to rectangles subtending angles from 30–330° was tested in a circular arena containing water that either lacked estuarine chemical cues (offshore water) or contained odors from aquatic vegetation or known predators. In the absence of chemical odors, larvae oriented toward and juveniles moved away from dark horizons subtending angles > 60°. When placed in water containing chemical odors from potential nursery habitats, including the seagrasses Halodule wrightii and Syringodium filiforme, crabs reversed their direction of orientation relative to their responses in offshore water. Odors from two known predators, the mummichug Fundulus grandis and blue crab Callinectes sapidus, had no affect on the orientation of larvae. Yet, juveniles responded to both odors by moving toward the visual target. Results support the hypothesis that the visual orientation of larval and juvenile horseshoe crabs changes upon exposure to habitat and predator cues and that the direction of the response undergoes an ontogenetic shift following metamorphosis.",10.1093/czoolo/56.5.618,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/czoolo/56.5.618

The disease is characterized by an inflammatory reaction of the mammary gland and is mainly caused by bacterial infections, including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The release of endotoxins associated to bacterial lysis is a weighty factor in the clinical course of Gram-negative associated mastitis and should be taken into consideration when using antibiotics in the treatment of these infections. Therefore, endotoxin detection in milk samples would be of help in the management of bovine mastitis. With this aim, we have validated a kinetic turbidimetric assay based on Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) for the quantification of endotoxins in milk samples. The assay was adapted to this particular matrix by incorporating filtration and dilution of the milk samples in the procedure. Our results demonstrate the robustness and usefulness of the assay, which allows the identification of coliform mastitis in milk samples from affected cows and the quantification of endotoxin activity in bulk and commercial milk samples. Further studies are required to evaluate the performance of the assay in mastitis milk samples associated to Gram-negative bacteria other than Escherichia coli as well as during the clinical course of these Gram-negative mastitis or after their treatment with antibiotics.",10.3390/ani13030427,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani13030427

Determination of the residual coagulogen by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system with monoclonal antibody against coagulogen revealed that the loss of the antigenicity of coagulogen was proportional to the concentration of endotoxin. An inverse linear curve was established between the endotoxin concentration and absorbance. Standard curves of the LAL enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with different detection limits (from 0.1 to 100 pg of the control standard endotoxin per ml) were obtained from one batch of commercial LAL by adjusting incubation time and dilution of LAL. The reaction curves of various endotoxins were parallel to one another, whereas the kinetics differed from that of (1-3)-beta-D-glucan. The LAL enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is a highly reproducible microassay, using only 10 microliter of test sample and LAL reagent; because the color and turbidity of plasma samples do not interfere with the assay, it is well suited for quantitation of endotoxins in clinical specimens.",10.1128/jcm.26.8.1464-1470.1988,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/jcm.26.8.1464-1470.1988

The software developed enables the robot to automatically dilute a stock reference endotoxin standard (20,000 endotoxin units per ml) for the construction of a five-point standard curve, make sample dilutions to the proper testing concentration, and perform chromogenic substrate LAL assays in duplicate. The linearity of the standard curve and the endotoxin concentration in each sample are calculated and results are printed automatically. In 48 min the automated system assays three samples and a reference standard in duplicate along with a water blank. Sensitivity of the assay is a function of incubation time. The assay is linear (r greater than 0.99) in the region of 0 to 1.0 endotoxin units per ml or 0 to 0.2 endotoxin units per ml with incubation times of 10 or 16 min, respectively. The method can be made very sensitive, detecting as low as 0.003 endotoxin units per ml with 30 min of incubation. The precision of the assay method, determined by assaying an endotoxin reference solution eight times, is ca. 6%.

We compared the immune stimulatory potency of 11 different LPSs using human whole blood incubations. While the majority of LPSs induced cytokine release equipotently, a 1000-fold more LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Vibrio cholerae was still less potent in inducing TNF, IL-1β, IL-10 and IFN-γ though it potently induced nanogram quantities IL-8. All LPSs tested, regardless of the micro-organism, showed Toll-like receptor (TLR)4-dependence, except for the LPSs from P. aeruginosa and V. cholerae, which were both TLR4- and TLR2-dependent. Interestingly, UV-inactivated P. aeruginosa bacteria, although Gram-negative, also showed TLR2- and TLR4-dependence. Repurification of commercial LPS preparations by phenol re-extraction led to a complete loss of the TLR2 dependency, indicating contamination with lipoproteins. In the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay, often performed to exclude contamination in purified water likely to originate from P. aeruginosa, P. aeruginosa LPS was only 2-fold less potent than LPS from S. abortus equi or the assay standard LPS from E. coli. This results in an overestimation of pyrogenic burden by a factor of 500 in the sample when compared with the biological activity of highly purified P. aeruginosa LPS in human whole blood.",10.1177/09680519060120030401,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09680519060120030401

In this contribution we review the sensory cues that male horseshoe crabs Limulus polyphemus are known to use when locating mates and then provide new data that shed light on this subject. During the breeding season, females migrate into shore during high tides to spawn. Males attach to females as they approach the beach or are attracted to pairs already spawning. Vision is well established as an important cue in attracting males. Although chemoreception is well known in other marine arthropods, and horseshoe crabs have the anatomy available, there are few studies on chemical cues in this species. Experiments are presented here that provide evidence for chemical cue use. We show that the attraction, and retention, of attached and satellite males to actively spawning females and mating pairs involves multimodal cues.",10.1093/czoolo/56.5.485,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/czoolo/56.5.485

A fixed 50 m×2 m transect was monitored with monthly surveys of the number of Limulus feeding pits from June to October 2009, May and June 2010. Snorkelling surveys were also carried out to observe individual behavior and examine the spatial scale of activity of individual animals. Results showed frequent and intensive use of the mudflat by foraging Limulus. Limulus were actively foraging within the survey area during all months surveyed. Foraging patterns exhibited a seasonal pattern with activity levels peaking in August 2009 and increased significantly towards the end of the study in June 2010. It was also shown that Limulus intertidal foraging persisted and peaked after the spring breeding season. Observations of foraging Limulus revealed that individual predators dig multiple pits within a single high tide, with little disturbance to the sediment in between. In addition to altering the perception of Limulus as a subtidal predator outside of the breeding season, findings from this study suggests a segregation of spawning and feeding habitats, thus underscoring the need to consider a wider range of critical habitats in the management of Limulus populations.",10.1093/czoolo/56.5.611,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/czoolo/56.5.611

A mixture of LAL reagent and endotoxin sample solution was incubated for 1 h. The endotoxin activated a cascade reaction of zymogens contained in the LAL to generate p-nitroaniline (pNA) which was then electrochemically detected by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The generated pNA gave a clear peak at –0.75 V vs. silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl), which increased with the concentration of endotoxin in the LAL assay solution. This DPV detection was performed using an electrode chip device fabricated from a diamond-like carbon-coated glass substrate.

HSC organs evaluated histologically included body wall (chitin, epidermis, dermis, and skeletal muscle), hepatopancreas, gut, gonads, book gills, eyes, heart, brain, and coxal gland. In descending order, lesions were most frequently identified in compound eye, body wall, book gills, hepatopancreas, chitinous gut, nonchitinous gut, heart, and brain; lesions were not observed in coxal gland or gonads. Hemocytes (also called amoebocytes) surrounded infectious agents and occluded ulcers. Large hemocyte aggregates had a central eosinophilic coagulum (ie, hemocyte coagulum). Cutaneous ulceration (34/60 cases), branchitis (29/48 cases), and ophthalmitis (17/20 cases) were common lesions and consistently associated with fungi, which were invasive into subjacent tissues, and/or bacteria, which were usually superficial. Fungal culture was performed in 3 cases and isolated Fusarium spp., although fungal morphology varied and multiple fungal species may have been present. Presumptive green algae were associated with ulceration in 1 case with minimal to no inflammation. Presumptive cyanobacteria were identified within a biofilm overlying the gills in 4 of 48 cases and were not invasive. Multifocal, random hepatopancreatitis was identified in 16 of 57 cases, 10 of which were associated with bacteria. Metacercarial cysts were identified in 25 of 61 cases and associated with minimal to no inflammation. Depleted eosinophilic globules in hepatopancreatic interstitial cells were interpreted as decreased nutritional status in 12 of 57 cases.",10.1177/0300985819859877,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300985819859877

As with other pharmaceutical formulations and medical devices intended for use in animals and human patients, contamination of nanoparticles with bacterial endotoxins should be thoroughly investigated before preclinical in vitro and in vivo characterization. Traditional methods to study endotoxin contamination include the in vitro quantitative Limulus Amebocyte Lysate test and the in vivo qualitative rabbit pyrogen test. Both of these tests have a long history of use for traditional pharmaceuticals and medical devices and are routinely used in drug development.

The LAL test and bacteriologic examination yielded concordant results with 26 out of 28 specimens. A positive LAL test was obtained with 11 specimens containing endotoxin-producing organisms. The test became positive within 60 min of incubation in 10 out of 11 specimens and in 1 specimen between 1 and 24 h, suggesting that, in the majority of specimens, endotoxin was present in the specimen itself and that the result was not due to the in vitro multiplication of the microorganisms. All negative tests remained negative for 24 h.

Sari, Noviantrio Gulo, Miftahun Najah, Fauziyah .",2020,"The body conditions indices were useful to determine an individual's well-being, and favorable food availability indicating a good environmental condition. The conditions of the mangrove horseshoe crab (Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda) might be related to several environmental parameters. The study's aim was to analyze the key environmental parameters affecting the body condition of C. rotundicauda found in Banyuasin Estuary Waters. The sampling was conducted in July 2019 in Banyuasin Estuary Waters.  The data of weight and prosomal width for C. rotundicauda were used to estimate the body conditions indices (relative condition factor). While the environmental parameters data were recorded for each sampling site. The backward stepwise regression was used to determine the key environmental parameters affecting the body condition indices.

Kynurenic acid (KA) was isolated from horseshoe crab in this study for the first time in the world. A previous study in 2018 reported that intraperitoneal administration of KA prevented high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced body weight gain. Now, we investigated the effects of intragastric gavage of KA on HFD mice and found that KA (5 mg/kg/day) inhibited both the body weight gain and the increase of average daily energy intake. KA reduced serum triglyceride and increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. KA inhibited HFD-induced the increases of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, coronary artery risk index, and atherosclerosis index. KA also suppressed HFD-induced the increase of the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (two dominant gut microbial phyla). KA partially reversed HFD-induced the changes in the composition of gut microbial genera. These overall effects of KA on HFD mice were similar to that of simvastatin (positive control). But the effects of 1.25 mg/kg/day KA on HFD-caused hyperlipidemia were similar to the effects of 5 mg/kg/day simvastatin. The pattern of relative abundance in 40 key genera of gut microbiota from KA group was closer to that from the normal group than that from the simvastatin group. In addition, our in vitro results showed the potential antioxidant activity of KA, which suggests that the improvement effects of KA on HFD mice may be partially associated with antioxidant activity of KA. Our findings demonstrate the potential role of KA as a functional food ingredient for the treatment of obesity and hyperlipidemia as well as the modulation of gut microbiota.",10.1155/2021/8874503,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/8874503

Jirillo, A.P. Moran",1995,"Different chemically characterized H. pylori LPS preparations, such as smooth (S)- and rough (R)-form LPS, a completely dephosphorylated R-LPS, and three lipid A chemotypes, from the S- and R- form LPS (S- and R-lipid A) as well as a dephosphorylated derivative of S-lipid A, respectively, were evaluated for expression of potency in a quantitative chromogenic Limulus amebocyte (CLAL) lysate assay and for release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) from activated human mononuclear cells. As far as the CLAL activity is concerned, no statistically significant differences could be observed between S- and R-LPS. Dephosphorylation of both R-LPS and S-lipid A caused a significant decrease of CLAL activity. In general terms, all the lipid A chemotypes were significantly less effective than the native LPS molecule and, in particular, R-lipid A expressed the lowest Limulus activity of all preparations. With regard to TNF-α release, R-LPS was the most potent inducer of this cytokine, even though its dephosphorylation reduced activity. In conclusion, the results show that phosphate groups influence both CLAL activity and, to a lesser extent, TNF-α release, and that the core oligosaccharide synergically cooperates with lipid A for the production of this cytokine, being, however, not essential for the expression of CLAL activity. Furthermore, preliminary structural data show that H. pylori D-glucosamine disaccharide backbone, besides being underphosphorylated at position 4', is also characterized by a reduced number of acyloxyacyl residues in comparison with enterobacterial lipid A. These findings, besides providing useful information on the structure-bioactivity relationships within H. pylori LPS, further support the evidence that this non-invasive, slow bacterium possesses the ability to modulate the local cellular immune response via LPS and related inflammatory cytokines.",10.1177/096805199600200609,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/096805199600200609

Bates, AMCC SEPSIS Project",1997,"We conducted a prospective study of a chromogenic LAL assay in 346 patients with sepsis syndrome, as defined by a modification of the Bone criteria, and 131 healthy volunteers at eight member centers of the Academic Medical College Consortium (AMCC). We identified patients with endotoxemia (> 0.40 EU/ml) by measuring LAL-reactive material in whole blood, extracted by the Tamura nitric acid method, with the chromogenic LAL (Pyrochrome®) assay. The mean result in sepsis patients with detectable endotoxemia (n = 241) was 1.07 ± 1.57 EU/ml, and the mean result in 131 volunteers was 0.151 ± 0.113 EU/ml, with 73% of the volunteers' results falling below the detectable limit. The average incidence of endotoxemia in sepsis patients was 33%, but varied 2.7-fold among the clinical centers (range 16-44%). Assay results were repeatable when samples tested frozen at the clinical sites were compared to results on frozen samples tested at Associates of Cape Cod, Inc. (ACC). Multiple samples were obtained from 40 patients at 18-24 h interval(s). Fourteen multidraw patients (35%) were endotoxemic at one or more draw(s) and eight of these patients had two or more draws with endotoxin levels > 1.0 EU/ml. The presence of sulfa drugs gave false positive results in two patient samples. A positive LAL test did not correlate with culture-proven bacterial infection and did not significantly correlate with mortality. There was a correlation ( P = 0.014) between a patient having a positive LAL test and the presence of a fungal infection when mixed fungal and bacterial infections were included. There was no correlation with a positive LAL test when only a fungal infection was present (P = 0.425) or when only a fungal and a Gram-positive infection was present ( P = 0.087).",10.1177/096805199700400102,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/096805199700400102

The HSC hemocytes store defense molecules that are released upon encountering invading pathogens. The HSCs rely on this innate immunity to continue its existence as a living fossil for more than 480 million years. To gain insight into the innate mechanisms involved, transcriptomic analysis was performed on isolated C. rotundicauda hemocytes challenged with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the main components of the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria. RNA-sequencing with Illumina HiSeq platform resulted in 232,628,086 and 245,448,176 raw reads corresponding to 190,326,253 and 201,180,020 high-quality mappable reads from control and LPS-stimulated hemocytes, respectively. Following LPS-stimulation, 79 genes were significantly upregulated and 265 genes were downregulated. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were related to multiple immune functional categories and pathways such as those of the cytoskeleton, Toll and Imd, apoptosis, MAP kinase (MAPK), inositol phosphate metabolism, phagosome, leucocyte endothelial migration, and gram-negative bacterial infection, among others. This study provides important information about the mechanisms of response to LPS, which is relevant for the understanding the HSCs’ immune response.",10.3390/cimb44120399,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cimb44120399

All the antibiotic preparations were depyrogenized by ultrafiltration treatment before they were subjected to the test. The reaction was conducted in the presence of a high concentration (0.5 M) of Tris buffer to constantly maintain the pH of the reaction mixture, and liberated p-nitroaniline was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several aminoglycosides (amikacin, bekanamycin, kanamycin, and streptomycin sulfate), bleomycin hydrochloride, and fosfomycin disodium showed no inhibition of the reaction up to 20 mg/ml. However, other antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, and tetracyclines, inhibited the reaction concentration dependently. Polymyxin B sulfate was the most potent inhibitor, with less than 8 micrograms/ml for 50% inhibition. It was concluded that the chromogenic method can be applied to the detection and determination of endotoxin in most of the antibiotic preparations.

The purified protein consisted of a single subunit of Mr 24 000 and agglutinated human blood-group-A+ erythrocytes. Its haemagglutinin activity was inhibited by purified lysate, coagulogen, but not by sugars. The haemagglutinin differed immunologically and in activity from the sialic-acid-binding lectin carcinoscorpin present in the haemolymph. It caused aggregation of forma-fixed amoebocytes, and on the basis of this observation its role in cell-cell adhesion is proposed. This new haemagglutinin promotes cell-cell aggregation in amoebocytes in a manner that shares some similarities with thrombospondin-mediated platelet aggregation in vertebrates [Jaffe, Leuang, Nachman, Levin & Moseher (1981) Nature (London) 295, 246-248].",10.1042/bj2300321,http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/bj2300321

People poisoning caused by consuming horseshoe crabs has also been reported. The aims of this study was to observe the bioactive compounds in every part of horseshoe crabs which suspected to be related to toxicity. The work was conducted to measure morphometrics, to count body proportions, and to determine phytochemical compositions, toxicity, and antioxidants in different body proportions. Female horseshoe crabs with average weight more than 500 g were obtained from the waters of Lamongan Regency in July 2018. The highest proportion of the different body parts was the shell and the lowest was viscera. Edible portions of horseshoe crabs were 45.39%. Meat contains low fat 1.97% and high fat in gonads 4.87%. The solvent that produces the best extracts from the gonads was ethanol and used to extract meat, viscera, and gills.

Lane,1978,"ABSTRACT: Stages leading to the formation of inverted gap junctions between certain basal replacement or interstitial cells in the mid-gut of adult Limultts can be followed by freeze-fracturing. Free, 13-nm EF intramembranous particles first appear to be organized into short linear arrays or small clusters of particles, which then become transformed into anastomosing particulate networks covering a considerable surface area. These subsequently become concentrated into smaller, more nearly circular, macular plaques of EF particles or PF pits. These EF particles, both when free or assembled into macular arrays, possess a central channel or pore. Numerous formed gap junctions are present in Limulus mid-gut, which suggests that cell-to-cell communication is an important feature of the mature tissue. The results show that arthropod tissues can be used to study the development of gap junctions not only in differentiating systems but also in adult tissues during normal cell turnover.",10.1242/jcs.32.1.293,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jcs.32.1.293

Gram-negative cell walls were also measured by using two-dimensional gas chromatography/electron-capture analysis of diaminopimelic acid originating from the peptidoglycan. The correlation between the results of the Limulus assay and those of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for determination of the lipopolysaccharide content in the dust samples was poor, whereas a good correlation was obtained between lipopolysaccharide and diaminopimelic acid concentrations with the gas chromatographic methods. The results suggest that it is predominantly cell-wall-dissociated lipopolysaccharides that are measured with the Limulus assay, whereas the gas chromatographic methods allow determination of total concentrations of lipopolysaccharide, including Limulus-inactive lipopolysaccharide, gram-negative cells, and cellular debris.",10.1128/aem.56.5.1271-1278.1990,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/aem.56.5.1271-1278.1990

Kaca, R.I. Roth, A. Ziolkowski, J. Levin",1994,"Previous studies have demonstrated that hemoglobin (Hb) and bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) form stable complexes and result in disaggregation of macromolecular LPS. To examine the effect of complex formation on LPS biological activity, we investigated the ability of Hb to alter LPS-induced activation of the coagulation cascade of Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) and expression of tissue factor from human endothelial cells. Both native HbAo and derivatized (covalently cross-linked) hemoglobin resulted in prominent enhancement of LAL activation and endothelial cell tissue factor production by Proteus mirabilis LPS. No substantial differences were observed between the enhancement effect of Hb on P. mirabilis smooth and rough LPS, indicating a dominant role for the lipid A component of LPS. Rough (Re) Salmonella min nesota 595 LPS also demonstrated both enhanced activation of LAL and stimulation of endothelial cell tissue factor in the presence of Hb. In contrast, neither lipid A nor singly dephosphorylated or partially deacylated Re LPS manifested significant enhancement of LAL activation by Hb, and partially deacylated Re LPS showed no enhancement of endothelial cell tissue factor by Hb. These results suggest that the Kdo moieties, as well as the phosphate residues and fatty acyl moieties of lipid A, may be involved in the interaction of Hb with LPS. Comparison of Hb with other endotoxin binding proteins for ability to cause enhancement of LPS biological activity demonstrated more prominent enhancement with lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) than that observed with Hb, lesser enhancement with albumin, and no enhancement effect with IgG or transferrin.",10.1177/096805199400100406,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/096805199400100406

When epidemiologic data suggest the association of contaminated intravenous (i.v.) fluids with disease, appropriate laboratory methods must be devised to analyze quickly the suspect fluid. A study was undertaken to compare three laboratory test methods (standard pour plate [SPP] technique, ATP procedure, and Limulus amebocyte lysate [LAL] assay) for detecting the presence of microorganisms in artificially contaminated i.v. fluid. SPP proved the most sensitive of the assay techniques used, but a 24-h period was required for microbial growth. The LAL assay appeared more sensitive in detecting i.v. contamination than the ATP method. These studies suggest that the LAL and ATP methods can be used for the rapid detection of microbial contamination in i.v. fluid. SPP and LAL procedures would have practical laboratory application when the contamination of i.v. fluids is suspected, and they are more sensitive in detecting microbial contamination in these solutions than the ATP method.",10.1128/jcm.23.3.465-468.1986,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/jcm.23.3.465-468.1986

Lipid A and lipid A-like compounds obtained from deep-rough mutants of Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli had a wide range of structural variations. These compounds included native lipopolysaccharides, diphosphoryl and monophosphoryl lipid A's, and lipid X (a monosaccharide). The LAL test was positive for all lipids tested with lysates from Travenol Laboratories and from Associates of Cape Cod (2.9 X 10(3) to 2.6 X 10(7) endotoxin units per mg), except for O-deacylated and dephosphorylated lipid X, which were negative. The Mallinckrodt lysate gave negative tests for lipid X. In the rabbit pyrogenicity and chicken embryo lethal dose tests, only native lipopolysaccharide and diphosphoryl lipid A's were judged toxic. The Shwartzman reaction was positive for a specific purified diphosphoryl lipid A (thin-layer chromatography-3 fraction) but negative for the purified monophosphoryl lipid A (also a thin-layer chromatography-3 fraction). These results show that the LAL test is not a valid measure of all parameters of toxicity of a lipid A or lipid A-like compound and can yield false-positive results. However, these findings are not in conflict with the widespread use of the LAL assay for pyrogens in the pharmaceutical industry since a good correlation exists between LAL results and pyrogenicity when undegraded endotoxin is evaluated in parallel assays.",10.1128/iai.45.2.350-355.1984,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/iai.45.2.350-355.1984

This reaction causes pyrogenicity in rabbits. The rabbit pyrogen test has been used for the pyrogen detection in parenteral drugs and medical devices. Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test, adopted as an alternative test for the rabbit pyrogen test in pharmacopoeias, has been safely used for more than 40 years. Even though the mechanisms of these biological assays are different, there should be similarity between the LAL test and the rabbit pyrogen test. Biological activity relates to the aggregation states of LPS, and there is still controversy whether the biologically active form of LPS is monomers or aggregates. Previous studies showed inconsistent results in biological activities of monomeric LPS. This suggests the difficulty to prepare monomeric LPS. Therefore, a simulation can be helpful to understand the activity of different status of LPS. In this study, the TLR4 activation was simulated by using simplified models, and compared the activity of LPS in different forms. The activation of TLR4 and the LAL activation require dimerization of receptors, which reduces the activity of monomeric LPS. The inert monomeric LPS caused by the dimerization of the receptors is the key to the similarity between the LAL test and the rabbit pyrogen test.",10.30574/wjarr.2022.14.1.0372,http://dx.doi.org/10.30574/wjarr.2022.14.1.0372

The canonical members, C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P component, have been identified in arthropods and humans. Mammalian pentraxins are known to bind lipid bilayers, and a pentraxin representative from the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, binds and permeabilizes mammalian erythrocytes. Both activities are Ca2+-dependent. Utilizing model liposomes and planar lipid bilayers, in the present study we have investigated the membrane-active properties of the three pentraxin representatives from Limulus and show that all of the Limulus pentraxins permeabilize lipid bilayers. Mechanistically, Limulus C-reactive protein forms transmembrane pores in asymmetric planar lipid bilayers that mimic the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and exhibits a Ca2+-independent form of membrane binding that may be sufficient for pore formation.",10.1042/bj20071357,http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/bj20071357

This paper reports a method for the combined determination of ergosterol and 3-hydroxy fatty acids in a single dust sample and a comparison of these chemical biomarkers determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with results from fungal culture and Limulus assay. Analyses of replicate house dust samples resulted in correlations of 0.91 (ergosterol in six replicates; P < 0.01) and 0.94 (3-hydroxy fatty acids in nine replicates; P < 0.001). The amounts of ergosterol (range, 2 to 16.5 ng/mg of dust) correlated with those of total culturable fungi (range, 6 to 1,400 CFU/mg of dust) in 17 samples, (r = 0.65; P < 0.005). The amounts of endotoxin (range, 11 to 243 endotoxin units/mg of dust) measured with a modified chromogenic Limulus assay correlated with those of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) determined from 3-hydroxy fatty acid analysis of 15 samples. The correlation coefficient depended on the chain lengths of 3-hydroxy acids used to compute the LPS content. The correlation was high (r = 0.88 +/- 0.01; P < 0.001) when fatty acid chains of 10 to 14 carbon atoms were included; the correlation was much lower when hydroxy acids of 16- or 18-carbon chains were included. In conclusion, the results of the described extraction and analysis procedure for ergosterol and 3-hydroxy fatty acids are reproducible, and the results can be correlated with fungal culture and endotoxin activity of organic dust samples.",10.1128/aem.63.7.2554-2559.1997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/aem.63.7.2554-2559.1997

1668,Reporting of New Rookeries and Habitat of Mangrove Horse Shoe Crab (Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda) from Eastern Indian Sundarbans,Amitava Aich,2022,"<p>Ground level survey along with key informant Interviews has resulted in to identification of two rookeries and several habitat of the mangrove Horseshoe crab (Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda) in Satjelia-Lahiripur Island under Gosaba block. This is the first confirmed HSC habitat and rookeries which have been identified from the eastern side of Bidyadhari and areas around project tiger areas. Three pairs of live HSC and forty-five (45) carcasses have been found. The identified location is the lowest point of human inhabited islands in eastern part of river Matla. Key Informant Interview by Snowball sampling or chain-referral sampling method revealed that that the HSC are sighted throughout the year while the pick time of sighting may be March-June in the estuary. The study has found out that HSCs entangle regularly in the galsha or the gillnet and Chawrpata and Khalpata (Shore stake nets and channel stake nets) while the juveniles have been mostly affected by the Chawrpata (shore stakes nets) in which they entangle themselves with receding waters and both desiccate to die in profuse numbers in low tide exposures. The females were found to be morphometrically larger than the males and are also found to be more prone to entangling in fishing nets. While the local population has reported about the coexistence of this species from time immemorial but progressive accretion and generation of new mud flats suitable as breeding beaches of mangrove horse shoe crabs in contrast to what is happening in their eroding rookeries in western Sundarbans might definitely be played some positive role towards this activities. Extensive awareness, restriction in use of certain fishing gears in breeding and nursery time of HSC by declaring certain areas as community eco sensitive zones with feasible fiscal alternatives are being recommended as immediate conservation action to save the species.</p>",10.32942/osf.io/gf6jm,http://dx.doi.org/10.32942/osf.io/gf6jm

Upon gelation of this protein, a large peptide, named peptide C, which has 28 amino acid residues, was released, and the resulting gel protein consisted of A and B chains, bridged by two disulfide linkages. This work is to determine the whole sequence of B chain and to compare with the primary structure of Tachypleus tridentatus (Japanese horseshoe crab) coagulogen previously established. The Limulus B chain was digested with trypsin and the resulting fragments were separated into 17 major peptides. For the sequence determination, manual Edman degradation was employed and resulting PTH amino acids were identified by HPLC. These analyses established the sequence of the isolated tryptic peptides, ending with the COOH-terminal serine, and the following whole sequence of Limulus coagulogen was presumed, comparing with that of Tachypleus coagulogen.",10.1055/s-0038-1652089,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1652089

The eggs measure ‘07 of an inch in diameter, and are green. In the ovary they are of various hues of pink and green just previous to being laid, the smaller ones being, as usual, white. The yolk is dense, homogeneous, and the yolk granules, or cells, are very small, and only in certain specimens, owing to the thickness and opacity of the egg-shell, could they be detected.",10.1242/jcs.s2-11.43.263,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jcs.s2-11.43.263

Millions of individuals spawning along the North American coastline from Maine in the United States to the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Other species can be found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean. The massive deposits of eggs along beaches provide a critical source of food for endangered migrating birds, especially the Red Knot (Calidruis canutus rufa) that feed along the mid-Atlantic Delaware Bay. Horseshoe crabs are also an important component of the sea turtle diet. In addition to their ecological importance, horseshoe crabs are used commercially for bait in eel and conch fisheries and for biomedical purposes in the production of Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) to detect bacterial toxins in injectable drugs and implantable devices. Commercial demands have led to population declines in some regions. The current International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listing for L. polyphemus is vulnerable. With growing interest in the health and stability of populations, and potential stressors that can contribute to decline, it is important to have clear and detailed descriptions of horseshoe crab anatomy and necropsy techniques. The purpose of this guide is to illustrate the normal anatomy and the step-by-step technique for dissection of horseshoe crabs. </p>",10.17504/protocols.io.bbktikwn,http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bbktikwn

1764,"Metabolic Endotoxemia, Feeding Studies and the Use of the Limulus Amebocyte (LAL) Assay; Is It Fit for Purpose?","Karma Pearce, Dianne Estanislao, Sinan Fareed, Kelton Tremellen",2020,"The Limulus amebocyte assay (LAL) is increasingly used to quantify metabolic endotoxemia (ME), particularly in feeding studies. However, the assay was not intended to assess plasma at levels typically seen in ME. We aimed to optimize and validate the LAL assay under a range of pre-treatment conditions against the well-established lipopolysaccharide binding protein assay (LBP). Fifteen healthy overweight and obese males aged 28.8 ± 9.1years provided plasma. The LAL assay employed a range of pre-treatments; 70 °C for 15 and 30 min and 80 °C for 15 and 30 min, ultrasonication (70 °C for 10 min and then 40 °C for 10 min), and dilution (1:50, 1:75, 1:100, and 1:200 parts) or diluted using 0.5% pyrosperse. Seventeen different plasma pre-treatment methods employed prior to the use of the LAL analytical technique failed to show any relationships with either LBP, or body mass index (BMI; obesity), the biological trigger for ME (p > 0.05 for all). As expected, BMI positively correlated with LBP (r = 0.523, p = 0.052. No relationships were observed between LAL with any of the sample pre-treatments and LBP or BMI. In its current form, the LAL assay is unsuitable for detecting levels of endotoxin typically seen in ME.",10.3390/diagnostics10060428,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10060428
